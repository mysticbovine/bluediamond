            <p>Thanks for providing such a wonderful trip. Unfortunately they say one only retains 20% of what they hear - so althrough you had a wealth of knowledge I will only be remembering 20% of what you told us.</p>

						<p>We cannot thank you enough for being our host and guide throughout Nova Scotia. We have fallen in love with this beautiful place and that's largely because of you. Your thoughtful and generous introductions to all we have seen and experenced here and in PEI guaranteed this being our trip of a lifetime. We will always remember Nova Scotia. Thank you, Bob, for sharing this adventure with us. We will never forget it, or you Sir!</p>

						<p>Thank you so much for making this trip such a memorable one for us. You were great. We learned much about our own country and enjoyed every minute of it. Your honesty is hard to be imagined. We had so much fun, felt so comfortable with your good driving and enjoyed all the little extra things you did to make it so easy for us to relax and enjoy. YOU are super. Best regards.</p>

						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Joanne was wonderful and very knowledge but more importantly she was a joy to spend the day with. Funny enough, our driver Stan was also a fun and entertaining driver. We all loved the tour and wish we could have spent more time there.</p> 
						<p>In Sydney Shaun was also wonderful and knowledgeable and a very good driver considering all the ground we covered. We had a great day and in Halifax. Dave was a wealth of information and a hoot to spend the day with. The weather held out for us, we had no problems in any city and everything went as smoothly as one could hope for. The planning of the tours and the execution of the tours were spot on and we can't thank you enough for everything you all did to make our vacation even better than we had hoped for. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I loved most about working with you and  your guides was the flexibility to make the tours ones that WE  wanted.  We saw what interested us most and we talked to others on  the ship, some of them were very disappointed with the big bus  experience and yet paid a fair chunk of change for that disappointment.   We however, walked away with smiles on our faces, a ton of pictures of the most  beautiful areas we have ever seen, and great memories.</p>
<p><strong>Marion W</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We thoroughly enjoyed it! Thank you so much! I will most definitely  be recommending your services to my clients. </p>

<p>We enjoyed our time with you so much and want you to know that the tours with Hilary and Florence were just great. They tried so hard to please and they certainly did. On our tour with Florence, we even got to feed the goats and that was an unexpected surprise! Thanks again for setting up the wonderful, interesting tours. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bebe and I would just like to extend a warm thank you  for going above and beyond last Thursday for your services you provided to our group.  The tour was flawless and they could not stop talking about how big their  Lobster Rolls were! Thank you for your hospitality and we hope to continue to  build a working relationship with you for future tours to your area.</p>

<p>I would like to thank you and your group for a  fantastic day touring the Halifax area. It was both educational and enlightening.</p>
<p><strong>Chuck W</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for  showing us all the sites.  We really enjoyed our day and felt we were able  to see a lot without feeling rushed.  Thanks for all your patience as we  worked through all the logistics. </p>

<p>We did have a great time on the tour with Dennis.
If we know of anyone visiting Halifax in  the future, we will recommend your company to them.</p>

<p>Just a note to let you know how much we enjoyed our tour  of the maritime provinces. Cathy and I have traveled all over the world and  Greg was the best tour guide we've ever had! Knowledgeable, entertaining and  accommodating to our requests above and beyond. Quite the story-teller as well.  He knew the areas and their histories, and he seemed to know people everywhere  we went. It was truly a pleasure to be chauffeured around by him every day. Thanks again for arranging our tremendous tour.</p>
<p><strong>Randy Y and 
Cathy B</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just talked to (my client).   He said that they truly enjoyed your tour, that there was more lobster  than they could eat, and that they loved their overnight on PEI.  He spoke  very highly of you</p>
<p>Thanks for taking good care of  my clients.</p>

<p>I  need to tell you that our day in Halifax was GREAT and it was because of your  tour.  Thanks so much.  All 14 of us enjoyed the day and the  wonderful tour!</p>
<p>          <strong>Craig P</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(The family), young and old, loved the tour. Halifax is so beautiful; what a perfect way to see your jewel of a city.</p>
<p>The bus was fantastic, and we cannot say enough great things about Dennis and Norm. The views,  the history lesson from Dennis, the food and the commaradrie among us made the tour the favorite part of many of the family's trip.</p>
<p><strong>Michelle M</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Oh  my gosh what a great time we all had!  The Bus was awesome Dennis was very  entertaining, we saw your beautiful port and we couldn't have asked for a  better tour.</p>

<p>  </p>
<p>I just wanted   to thank you  for the  wonderful tours you gave us. We all throughly enjoyed  the two days. Thanks for showing us your wonderful province. Isn't Canada a  great country? </p>

<p>Thanks so much, Bob. We had such a grand time with you.  Very  very nice.  Thank you.  And Annie also appreciates very much all the  articles and things you collected for her scrapbook.  How generous of  you.  We also had a great time at the events on Saturday night, as well as  the Titanic dinner on Sunday evening.  I highly recommend the dinner.</p>

<p>Just wanted to let you  know that we thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Nova Scotia with Blue  Diamond.   Greg and Stan were excellent, the weather  couldn't have been better, and the scenery was outstanding.  Will  recommend your company to anyone that we hear is planning a trip up your  way.</p>

<p>We just got home to Kansas and we  were talking about what a great time we had and how much we loved the tour Al  gave us! He was so informative and friendly! We actually said that we thought  the tour was the best we ever had! Thanks so much for everything!<br />

<p>Thank you for touching base with me about our  tour of Peggy's Cove. All went well and our group of six enjoyed the day with  Dennis.</p>
<p><strong>Linda K </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I  wanted you to know how my husband is describing our Blue Diamond tour...he  tells everyone it wasn't like a tour, more like an old friend  picking you up at the pier and taking you around.  Greg  was the BEST!!  We laughed and laughed all day with him.  Enjoyed it  all.  Next time in Halifax, we'll contact you again and do another  tour. Thanks again for a quality product (yes, interesting  too).  </p>
<p><strong>Janet</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for a most wonderful day, we thoroughly enjoyed  every minute. We do hope one day to return to such a beautiful part of the  world.We will certainly not hesitate to use your expert services  when we return.</p>
<p><strong>Chris, Rosaleen and Alex</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, the choice of your  tour company was a good one.  The family enjoyed all the tour guides and  they all did a very good job.   Dennis was a good tour guide and we enjoyed his presentations and  knowledge.  </p>
<p><strong> Ed J.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We really enjoyed our tours with  (our guides).   Both were a lot of fun to be around and we certainly enjoyed all the local  flavor that they brought to our walks &amp; sightseeing.   we  would appreciate you passing on our thanks for a great time.</p>
<p><strong>Jim &amp; Linda G</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We   enjoyed our tours with Blue Diamond. We could not have asked for a better  tour of PEI or Halifax. You are both excellent tour guides and a pleasure to be  with.</p>
<p>Thanks  again and I will be sure to pass your name on to other visitors to Nova Scotia.</p>
<p><strong>Marian  S</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you, Bob, for a  wonderful day of sightseeing! It was a great tour.I will recommend you to others, certainly. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bob, Just to let you know that the  trip to Peggy's cove was the outstanding part of the trip. I took lots of  pictures and loved all them the first time around. The second look, I removed  some,but will have to go through them again,to bring down the total of really  good shots. The scenery was just what I imagined it to be, so the trip was  made. Thanks for your guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Sam and Marilyn K</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to thank you  and Dennis heartily for the wonderful excursion and tour he gave us last  Thursday. My mom hasn't yet settled down from recounting to my siblings and her  friends and her voice gets softer when she still marvels at the way God  tossed all those boulders at Peggy's Cove. She says that was her favorite  of all places. Since she was a missionary in Beirut, Lebanon for almost 50  years, she is quite acquainted with the massive rocks at the Roman ruins in  Baalbeck, Tyre, and Byblos. She says they don't hold a candle to what she saw  on the tour.</p>
<p><strong>Evelyn B.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to congratulate your company for this  beautiful tour.</p>

<p>We  really had a great time on your tour and my wife is still talking about the  tidal bore on Salmon river. I hope all your guests experienced your awesome timing when viewing  the bore.</p>

<p>We really enjoyed our visit with you.  We will be back there in 2010.  Can you meet us and give us  another tour then? </p>
<p><strong>Joe and Linda H</strong></p>

<p>Really enjoyed the visit to Grand Pre.  Could  have spent the whole day there! Thanks for arranging that!  It was really  great to see family names of grandparents, friends and other relatives there!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bob, I want to thank you  for the great tour you gave us to Peggy's Cove.  It was a great day, and  we were so pleased with the services you provided.  I have already had an  opportunity to recommend you to someone else and will continue to do so.</p>

<p>A quick note to tell you THANKS for a wonderful  tour on behalf of my group. <br />
So many kept telling me how much they enjoyed  your knowledge and sharing of it with us. </p>
<p> I know its your job, but I also see the passion  your have rather than just the job. <br />
We have had lots of guides that talk just to be  talking but not really sharing such great info as you. </p>
<p> <strong>Renee Donte </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Had a look at your DIY link - great - really appreciate your guidance.</p>

<p>(We) ...  wish to thank you so  much for our memorable and informative visit to the Maritimes.
We were very fortunate to have you as our guide, as you know the  history and places of interest as well.</p>
<p> The day we spent with Florence in PEI was very informative and  enjoyable as well.Your choice of lodgings and meals was first class.</p>
<p> We will definitely be recommending Blue Diamond Tours to anyone  planning a trip to the Maritimes.</p>

<p>I would   like to say that you have worded your website well - it is interesting to  read and makes you feel confident that you will have an enjoyable time. </p>
<p> I am a hospitality person, and I set up a hotel school in  Brunei (South-East Asia) hence I have a special interest in reading web  pages that make people want to experience what you have to offer. The DIY tours  are a wonderful idea and makes your company sound far less commercial than  most! Well done!</p>

<p>Enjoyed the Prince  Edward Island tour and having dinner with Anne of Green Gables. She ( Anne of Green Gables) was  celebrating her 100th Anniversary, my husband and I were celebrating our 49th  wedding anniversary. Also loved the play and the souvenir book.</p>
<p> The Stompin Tom Ballard  was different than what I expected: was great and interesting.</p>
<p> I loved the small group,  also the North Winds Motel at Brackley Beach and the buffet breakfast.</p>

<p>This was my first time on a   FreeStyle Series Van Tour and I wasn't sure what to expect but  everything went great;  from the time I was picked up at my home  until the time I was  returned to my home,  I had no worries and  could just sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.  </p>
<p>The thing that impressed me the  most about this trip was the fact that we had a very full schedule from the  time we left until we returned home but in no way did we ever feel  rushed.  We had lots of time for touring - with a commentary on different  sites of interest, shopping, exploring and having leisurley  meals.   </p>
<p>Thank you very much for making this  tour such an enjoyable time.</p>
<p><strong>B. Shrum</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We really enjoyed the  trip, especially the little extra side trips you took us on. It was above and  beyond the call of duty and we both thoroughly enjoyed the trip. Many thanks  and God Bless you ! You are an excellent driver. We felt very safe  with you driving. </p>

<p>Our trip was for eleven days and we  never wanted the trip to end. We were treated like royalty and our every need  was taken care of very professionally and personally. Unlike other tours we have been on  in a bus, this tour in a van was able to become very personalized. We traveled  quaint highways and passed through many little towns.</p>
<p>Our meals and hotel accommodations  were superb. We were never rushed in the mornings and had plenty of time to  take care of our personal needs. We were able to choose to stop if  we  needed.</p>
<p>We would highly recommend Bob and  his tours. We have found a new friend and tour guide in Bob.</p>
<p><strong>George and Ivy</strong></p>

<p>Thanks again for the tour.

<p>I wanted to thank you for the absolutely top notch tour you gave us. The   amount of knowledge that you shared with us was unbelievable. My Dad and sister   both told me that it was the highlight of our trip. When I show the trip   pictures to others I've got loads of stories to tell them, rather than just this   is Peggy's Cove etc... So once again thanks for a unique, informative and   humourous experience that I'll remember every time I look at my Halifax   pictures.</p>
