							<p class="lead">Established in 1995, Blue Diamond Tours began by conducting shore excursions and bus tours for cruise ship passengers as a"contractor"firm for a variety of local and international tour operators. We continued to provide that service, but as the 1990's slipped into the new century, Blue Diamond Tours grew and began to offer more of our own, unique, Blue Diamond excursions.</p>
              <p>As time moved on, so did the wants of our clients. Not only did they want one day shore excursions but they expressed interest in multi-day, private, customized tours of <b>Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and the Fundy coastlines of both Nova Scotia and New Brunswick</b>.</p>
              <p>Blue Diamond Tours is proud to be able to offer an ever wider selection of multi-day excursions.</p>
              <p>Today, in <?php echo date("Y");?>, we proudly offer a diverse menu of tours ( approx. 25 and counting ) created exclusively for our clients and would be thrilled to create your personal tour!</p>
              <p><strong>Our tour services can include the following:</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li><b>Halifax, Nova Scotia</b> a city full of a diverse maritime history.</li>
              <li><b>Peggy's Cove</b> the most photographed place in Canada year after year.</li>
              <li><b>Lunenburg</b> a <em>UNISCO World Heritage Community</em> and the <em>Fisheries Capital of the World</em>.</li>
              <li><b>Grand Pr&eacute;</b> site of the expulsion of the <em>Acadian/Cajuns</em> in 1755.</li>
              <li><b>Cabot Trail in Cape Breton</b>, a scenic trail that outshines The Scottish Highlands.</li>
              <li><b>Prince Edward Island</b> home of <em>"Anne of Green Gables"</em> and the birthplace of Canada.</li>
              <li><b>Hopewell Cape, New Brunswick</b> also known as <em>"the flower pots of the Bay of Fundy"</em>.</li>
              <li>and much much more </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Why Choose Blue Diamond?</h2>
              <p><strong>We tailor your excursion to fulfill your specific requests / requirements.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>We can and will alter your itinerary to include what </strong><strong>you and </strong><strong>your </strong><strong>companions </strong><strong>want to do and see.</strong><br /> Your excursion is just that; your excursion, so while we offer a variety of itineraries / experiences to choose from, <strong>they all can be tailored to suit you</strong><strong> and your companions </strong><strong> tastes and wishes</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>As with snowflakes, no two tours are ever exactly the same.</strong><br /> There's a personal touch added to each trip. Our tours are <strong><em>not of the"cookie cutter"variety - we're home-made and unique!</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Tour only with who you want.</strong><br /> Your excursion party is just you and yours -<em> no strangers</em> or <em>large crowds!</em>   </p>
              <p>In this way, the focus remains on you and you group - not the itinerary, clock, or on people you don't know.</p>
              <p>As the itinerary is your own, it is flexible too. We use the time of your excursion to do and see the things you want to do and see!</p>
              <p>This is your tour / your vacation, and we want to make it special for you with memories that will last a lifetime!</p>
