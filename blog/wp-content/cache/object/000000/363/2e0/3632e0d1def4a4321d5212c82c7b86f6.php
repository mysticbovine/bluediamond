By way of introduction, theÂ author, is a tour operator who creates custom, privateÂ shore excursions for three ports in the Maritime Provinces.Â His career started in 1995 when for the first six years he wasÂ working as a tour guide for a firm conducting cruise ship shore excursions at Halifax.

Cruise linesÂ offer organized shore excursions on all ships for profit, they are one of their "profit centres " along with selling liquor, gambling, selling merchandise and taking pictures).Â These tours can be booked onboard at theÂ excursions desk orÂ before you depart on your trip.

The benefits of these, some say are many.Â No worries about making arrangements,Â the tour provider and the ship will wait even if your excursion gets back late.Â Most cruise ships prominently feature this fact - if you book privately and get back late -- your ship will not wait.Â In my fourteen plus years escortingÂ cruise excursions - the only late tours I am aware of wereÂ ship's tours.Â Another added benefit is meetingÂ other shipmates whose company you'll enjoy back on the ship.Â SometimesÂ a ship excursion is aÂ bus ride with stops atÂ souvenir shops.Â But, you doÂ know the cost, where &amp; when you are to meet your guide (just follow the other 50 people) and youÂ have been given a somewhat detailed outline of your tour, plus, you will never miss your shipÂ but youÂ payÂ forÂ letting the cruise line make your arrangements.

In all of the Atlantic Provinces ports there are private tour operators not affiliated in any way with any cruise line who offer tours/excursions similar to ship offerings. As stated not all offerings are the same nor are the prices the same or similar.
<h2>Your first step is to plan ahead.</h2>
Learn about the ports your cruise ship will be visiting,Â borrowÂ guidebook(s) onÂ Atlantic Canada and/or the Maritime Provinces.Â The Internet, itself, canÂ be a source of information. Make a list of sites - places - things you'd like to see and do for each port you will be visiting.Â Remember, you generally have about eight hours or less in any port.Â This means, you willÂ be limited to traveling about 80 miles or less from the cruise ship dock area.

Next, check your ship's offerings.Â Are sites, places, etc. onÂ your listÂ included in any of their offerings?Â At what price? Now, search for private tour operatorsÂ - example <a href="http://www.HalifaxShoreExcursions.com" target="_blank">www.HalifaxShoreExcursions.com</a> look at what they offer.Â Are any of your listÂ places, sites, items included in any of their tours/excursions?

Another determination you must make is, with any shore excursion, do you wish to travel with a group of 40 or so fellow ship-mates or would you rather be on your own? Each way has both pluses and minuses attached to them.

There are really only two types of shore excursions or tours
<h2>1.Â  "Cookie-cutter" excursions</h2>
For the lack of a better description the "cookie-cutter" trip: an excursion that takes a predetermined amount of time, including stops and returns to the ship's docking area.Â Generally half-day (3 to 4 hour) trips or full day outings (5 to 7 hours).Â These are offered by both the ship's themselves and by private tour operators.Â They will always give you a cost, in their on-line information.Â This the hallmark ofÂ "cookie-cutter" tours, the price is included in any/all information. Another is no flexibility.
<h2>2. The custom toursÂ and/or shore excursions:</h2>
The tour operator will change anyÂ of hisÂ " suggested " itineraries to meet your requests and requirements - to include your requested sites, places, things to do, trips really designed partly by you.Â The hallmarkÂ of these types of outings is a lack of a posted price, as there are numerous unknown variables involved. Additionally, these tours are noted for flexibility.
<h2>Some other things to consider:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Is the tour operator or providerÂ a full-time tour operatorÂ or areÂ shore excursions merely a sidelineÂ to/for another business ie a taxi or limo business.</li>
	<li>Ask if you will be traveling with other people or will it be just you and yours.Â Public style excursions (where one or more "others" join you in touring) tend to slant towards a "cookie cutter "outing even if custom elements are included.</li>
	<li>Ask questions, learn as much as you can about the area, the attractions, the port itself, and the tour operator too.Â Also, ask about the level of activity involved with any excursion (whetherÂ of your design or not) how much walking, the terrain, hilly, level and how often you'll be in and out of the tour vehicle.Â Stops, how many and rest stops - where and when --- snacks - again where, when and for how long. Shopping or no shopping?</li>
	<li>What is most important to you?Â Quality or price?Â Generally many times it is one or the other.Â Have and set a realistic budget.Â Your ship's tour prices are a good starting guide, but remember their prices areÂ based on large numbers ie 40 to 45 persons.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The next step</h2>
Once you are satisfied and have made a decision . . . it is time to book your excursion, immediately.Â You may ask why, especially if it is February and your cruise is taking place in October.Â It is important especially if youÂ have selected a private operator excursion.Â Most private operators have aÂ limited capacity on any given day, and also operate on a first-come basis. By booking early you will be assuredÂ ofÂ taking your preferredÂ excursion.

Early confirmed bookings are essential, for cruises arrivingÂ from late August through the end of October.Â In 2010, the Port of Halifax had about 114 cruise ship visits (in less than 70 days).Â The other ports of St John, Sydney and Charlottetown also saw a record number of cruise ship visits, in that time frame, too. This means, generally a shortage of tour capacity plus disappointment for many who wait to the last minute to book an excursion.";s:10:"post_title";s:48:"Cruise Ship Shore Excursions of Atlantic Canada ";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:44:"cruise-ship-shore-excursions-atlantic-canada";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2011-03-05 20:41:51";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2011-03-06 00:41:51";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:38:"http://bluediamondtours.com/blog/?p=77";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
