This is the first summer in six years the ferry has been running and although a wonderful, quick passage between two countries, it has been experiencing low ridership.Â  Our visitors certainly seemed to have enjoyed the 5.5hr crossing.

From Yarmouth, we drove along the South Shore of Nova Scotia, stopping in Lunenburg before heading into Halifax, which is where our visitors would be based for the next few days.

Our first full day took us to the Annapolis Valley so we could explore the Bay of Fundy. Beginning in Hallâ€™s Harbour, we saw quite a dramatic seascape as the tide was out and the ocean floor exposed. Â We meandered our way down the mountain, through Port Williams and Wolfville to Grand Pre.Â  Here we learned about the sad history of the Acadian deportation and also visited the Deportation Cross, a memorial to the Acadians deported from here.

We then headed to Evangeline Beach which offers breath taking views of Blomidon and the Bay of Fundyâ€¦ quite a contrast to the city and indeed, other shorelines in the Province.

Our visitors had the chance to explore Halifax under the city lights by night and with BDT during the day.Â  Following a tour of the town, we meandered our way to Peggyâ€™s Cove and, upon discovering it was one of the visitors birthdays, we had a delightful celebratory lunch at Rhubarb in Indian Cove.

Iâ€™m sure it was an early night for all, as I collected them at 4am the following morning to take them to the airport.";s:10:"post_title";s:15:"From Sea to Sky";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:17:"from-ferry-to-air";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-08-18 20:05:15";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-08-19 00:05:15";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:39:"http://bluediamondtours.com/blog/?p=516";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
