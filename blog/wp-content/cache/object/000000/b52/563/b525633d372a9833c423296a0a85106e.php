Many people who visit Nova Scotia want to see the Worldâ€™s Highest Tides, which is fantastic, we have that to offer.Â  However, Time and Tide wait for no-one and if it means getting up at the crack of dawn to witness low tide, so be it.

In order to see low-tide in Hallâ€™s Harbour, we had to leave Halifax at 6:15am â€“ not your ideal vacation start time!Â  It was worth it.Â  We saw the Bay of Fundy empty, in all its muddy gloryâ€¦.but then what to do?Â  Certainly no attractions were open that early in the morning.Â  So breakfast, but where?Â  Where else than the Big Stop in New Minas.Â  This was certainly a first for me and thoroughly enjoyed by my guests.

By the time breakfast was finished, the world had come to life and we were able to visit Grande Pre before heading back to Hallâ€™s Harbour to view high-tide.

Iâ€™ve never thought about adding the Big Stop into an itinerary, but judging by how busy it was and how much it was enjoyed, itâ€™s left me with something to think about.";s:10:"post_title";s:26:"Seriouslyâ€¦the Big Stop?!";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:21:"seriouslythe-big-stop";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-08-28 07:11:45";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-08-28 11:11:45";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:39:"http://bluediamondtours.com/blog/?p=527";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
