Peggyâ€™s Cove is a relatively short drive from Halifax so we often include it in our shore excursions, incorporating other â€œattractionsâ€ along the way.Â  This may include anything from quaint fishing villages to the Swiss Air 111 Memorial site, located on St. Margaretâ€™s Bay.

As taken from NS Tourism<em>:</em>

<em>On September 2, 1998 Swissair Flight 111 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean southwest of Halifax Stanfield International Airport at the entrance to St. Margaretâ€™s Bay. All 229 people on board perished. The crash site was 8 km / 5 mi from the shore, not far from Peggyâ€™s Cove in the South Shore region. A short walking trail (30 m) to a monument in memory of the people who lost their lives can be found at the Swissair Memorial Site in Peggyâ€™s Cove in the South Shore region.</em>

It is a lovely memorial and well worth visit. Just down the road is another memorial, a burial ground containing remains of those found at sea after the disaster.Â  It is a peaceful spot and for me, always reminds me of a tour from a couple of years ago:

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-589" src="http://bluediamondtours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_1477-e1474022605491-225x300.jpg" alt="img_1477" width="225" height="300" />

I had the pleasure of accompanying a Swiss couple on a shore excursion.Â  When creating their itinerary, they said a visit to the Swiss Air memorial was a must.Â  Not a problem as I often include it on my trip along the St Margaretâ€™s Bay coastline.

As we explored the memorial, the reason for including it in their tour soon became apparent.Â  The couple had been neighbours with Urs Zimmerman â€“ the pilot of Swiss Air Flight 111.Â  They spoke fondly of Zimmerman and told me not only was he a pilot, but also an instructor, prior to which he was a fighter pilot with the Swiss Air Force.Â  He was a wonderful, friendly neighbour and left behind a wife and three children.

Now, when I visit the memorial and burial site, I canâ€™t help but think of the Swiss couple and Urs Zimmerman.Â  I feel very privileged to have been part of their goodbye to a dear friend and neighbour.";s:10:"post_title";s:13:"Swiss Air 111";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:13:"swiss-air-111";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-09-16 06:44:00";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-09-16 10:44:00";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:39:"http://bluediamondtours.com/blog/?p=588";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:1;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:3:"571";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"5";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2016-09-11 18:28:18";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2016-09-11 22:28:18";s:12:"post_content";s:5925:"Many of our tours take us to Hallâ€™s Harbour, itâ€™s a popular place to witness high/low tides, spectacular scenery and of course, lobster.Â  However, there is another area in Nova Scotia, which offers spectacular views of the Bay of Fundy, scenic sites/sights and awesome foodâ€¦.and begins within an hour of Halifax!

From Halifax, a 45min drive took us to Shubenacadie - an interesting community with Miâ€™kmaq origins: "The Mi'kmaq spelling, Sipekne'katik, means the area where the wild turnips or wild potatoes grow.â€

With Miâ€™kmaq and Acadian history subtly around, Shubenacadie also boasts to be the â€œMilk Capital of Canadaâ€!Â  We had to stop in the <strong>Shubenacadie Tin Smith Shop Museum</strong> for a quick look around (and also purchase items from its super â€˜craftâ€™ gift shop).

We followed the road along the Shubenacadie River, passing through dots of communities which were once, larger bustling areas.Â  A quick stop at the South Maitland Interpretive Centre which allowed for a spectacular view <em>over</em> the Bay of Fundy, by way of their boardwalk.Â  There was another trail leading along the marshes which is known to have superb â€˜birdingâ€™, perhaps another time.

Maitland is a small community and home to the oldest general store in Canada (circa 1839) and also the home of W. D. Lawrence, who built the largest wooden ship ever to be built in Canada!Â  The store is still running and the W.D. Lawrence Museum open â€“ this unassuming, sleepy little village, has a big story to tell and more than willing to share!Â  It also offers absolutely stunning, unparalleled views of the Bay of Fundy!

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-584" src="http://bluediamondtours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0743-300x225.jpg" alt="img_0743" width="300" height="225" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-585" src="http://bluediamondtours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0746-300x225.jpg" alt="img_0746" width="300" height="225" />

Although we didnâ€™t have time on this tour, this area also offers tidal bore rafting and mudsliding â€“ two unique options for those seeking adventure!

The quiet country road took us along the shoreline of the Bay of Fundy which offered spectacular scenery!Â  We popped into the <strong>East Hants Historical Society Museum</strong> (super little placeâ€¦ and for Titanic enthusiasts who think they have â€œseen it allâ€, think again! This museum houses an embalming table which is believed to have been used for John Jacob Astor â€“ the richest man aboard the Titanic!).

A short distance away is Anthony Provincial Park.Â  What a story this park had to tell us!Â  Itâ€™s beautiful, scenicâ€¦with a replica Atomic Bomb in it!

<em>â€œThe American Navy had been testing bombs in Florida and were using divers to retrieve them from the ocean. This was found to be cumbersome so the Navy searched North America for an alternative. The alternative was the Bay of Fundy. It was chosen because bombs could be dropped during high tide and then retrieved during low tide by driving onto the mud flats.Â â€œ</em>

There is so much more to this story, but WOW, in our back yard!

Leaving there, we headed to Burncoat Head - Home of the Worlds Highest Tides.

Our next stop was Walton, home toÂ â€œlast original lighthouse in Hants Countyâ€! What a glorious sight, steeped in so much history and gorgeous scenery.

Following the shoreline along the Bay of Fundy, we ended our trip with a visit to the <strong>Flying Apron Inn and Cookery. </strong>Â Â This award winning little eatery was a superb way to end our alternative Bay of Fundy Visit!

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-581" src="http://bluediamondtours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_1452-e1473632432349-225x300.jpg" alt="img_1452" width="225" height="300" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-582" src="http://bluediamondtours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_1456-e1473632411619-225x300.jpg" alt="img_1456" width="225" height="300" />

So it may not be Hallâ€™s Harbour.Â  You will not witness high and low tides in a quick excursion.Â  You will, however, see scenery like no other, learn about little known history, have the opportunity for adventures offered nowhere else in the world and enjoy Hants County Hospitality!

It was quite a spectacular sight and certainly kept tourism operators in the area very busy!

I had the wonderful pleasure of touring a group travelling on this ship around the greater Halifax and Dartmouth area.

<em>â€œNot only did the gent I saw remind me of you, he had nearly the same Tilley hat you wore.Â  He also was very happy. As part ofÂ Iceland's tourism activities, they're bringing in lots of cruise ships from US, Canada, and Europe. I remember you telling us that was your specialty, so I assumed when I saw your double that was why you were there.â€</em>

Well, yes, my Tilley hat is a telltale sign of me, cruise ship excursions are certainly a big part of my business, but I havenâ€™t taken any trips to Iceland nor am I running excursions in Icelandâ€¦.I think I had to do a little convincing with my wife that I am not an international jet-setter!

I decided to spend some time with Ann and explore our own back yard.Â  We began in Halifax Public Gardens which is a glorious sight at this time of year.Â  Multiple weddings were being photographed, children were darting in and out of the flowers, but what really captured my attention were the Dahlias!Â  On, August 31<sup>st</sup>, Halifax is home to an<strong>Â Annual Dahlia Day Celebration, </strong>hosted by the Halifax Public Gardens &amp; the Nova Scotia Dahlia Society and judging by the display in the gardens, it will be a spectacular celebration!

From the city sights to country roads, Ann and I travelled along the Bay of Fundy and spent time exploring Baxters Harbour, Long Beach and Canning.

Many people who visit Nova Scotia want to see the Worldâ€™s Highest Tides, which is fantastic, we have that to offer.Â  However, Time and Tide wait for no-one and if it means getting up at the crack of dawn to witness low tide, so be it.

In order to see low-tide in Hallâ€™s Harbour, we had to leave Halifax at 6:15am â€“ not your ideal vacation start time!Â  It was worth it.Â  We saw the Bay of Fundy empty, in all its muddy gloryâ€¦.but then what to do?Â  Certainly no attractions were open that early in the morning.Â  So breakfast, but where?Â  Where else than the Big Stop in New Minas.Â  This was certainly a first for me and thoroughly enjoyed by my guests.

By the time breakfast was finished, the world had come to life and we were able to visit Grande Pre before heading back to Hallâ€™s Harbour to view high-tide.

A full day of touring took us to the coast to visit Peggyâ€™s Cove, a Nova Scotia must-do for all visitors.Â  From there, we meandered along the Lighthouse Route and popped into the quaint community of Mahone Bay, known for its artisans, shopping and fabulous restaurants.Â  We ended the day with a visit to Lunenburg, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, stunning architecture and beautiful views of the coastline.

Visiting the dramatic tidal changes in the Bay of Fundy is a must-do.Â  After experiencing low tide in Hallâ€™s Harbour, we made our way down the mountain offering superb views of the fertile fields in full swing with their produce.Â  At the bottom of the mountain is a rather gorgeous little museum, just off the beaten track, Prescott House.Â  The Georgian House with manicured gardens is definitely a place worth visitingâ€¦before heading back to Hallâ€™s Harbour to witness high-tide.

A quick trip into Wolfville was a must-do for me, as I had a beautiful care package my wife had prepared for my granddaughter, who works in the Wolfville VIC - Tourism is evidently in our genes!Â  Quite a handy place to pop into, not just for me but also my guests.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-517" src="http://bluediamondtours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/The-Cat.jpg" alt="The Cat" width="299" height="168" />

This is the first summer in six years the ferry has been running and although a wonderful, quick passage between two countries, it has been experiencing low ridership.Â  Our visitors certainly seemed to have enjoyed the 5.5hr crossing.

From Yarmouth, we drove along the South Shore of Nova Scotia, stopping in Lunenburg before heading into Halifax, which is where our visitors would be based for the next few days.

Our first full day took us to the Annapolis Valley so we could explore the Bay of Fundy. Beginning in Hallâ€™s Harbour, we saw quite a dramatic seascape as the tide was out and the ocean floor exposed. Â We meandered our way down the mountain, through Port Williams and Wolfville to Grand Pre.Â  Here we learned about the sad history of the Acadian deportation and also visited the Deportation Cross, a memorial to the Acadians deported from here.

We then headed to Evangeline Beach which offers breath taking views of Blomidon and the Bay of Fundyâ€¦ quite a contrast to the city and indeed, other shorelines in the Province.

Our visitors had the chance to explore Halifax under the city lights by night and with BDT during the day.Â  Following a tour of the town, we meandered our way to Peggyâ€™s Cove and, upon discovering it was one of the visitors birthdays, we had a delightful celebratory lunch at Rhubarb in Indian Cove.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-512" src="http://bluediamondtours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_1024-e1471083563120-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_1024" width="225" height="300" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-513" src="http://bluediamondtours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_1028-e1471083716212-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_1028" width="225" height="300" />

Still working fishing villages, as can be evidenced by the fishing boats and lobster traps, the communities also boast a large artisan population.Â  This is not new.Â  Beginning in the 1900â€™s, this area attracted many artists, including Wallace MacKaskill, Joseph Purcell, William E. deGarthe and Jack L. Gray.Â  And who could blame them?Â  With gorgeous inlets surrounded by blue slate rocks, it truly is a beautiful, captivating area.

It is reported that Blue Rocks is â€œLunenburgâ€™s answer to Peggyâ€™s Coveâ€ and the fish shack, sitting in the water, is the most photographed building in the county!Â  Whatever may be, I think it is a perfect place for a picnic on the rocks.

Beginning in the Port City, we enjoyed a peaceful stroll around Halifax Public Gardens, which truly is a splendid sight at this time of year, full of colour and scents.Â  A short drive took us to Citadel Hill allowing for stunning views of the city and where we could witness the noon-gun salute.Â  Our guests also enjoyed some great meals in the downtown area and even managed to find copies of their immigration papers at Pier 21!

We had absolutely gorgeous weather to explore the Eastern Shore!Â  Beginning with a stroll on the Dartmouth Waterfront we then cruised along the shoreline to visit the Fishermanâ€™s Life Museum and took a step back in time at Memory Lane Village.

An early morning departure from the city took us to Peggyâ€™s Cove, where we enjoyed breakfast on the rocks before meandering along the coastline to the quaint fishing village of Lunenburg.Â Â  Then to a very different fishing village on the other side of the Province, Hallâ€™s Harbour.Â  Here, we could witness the glory of the Bay of Fundy and the dramatic difference in the high and low tides.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-501" src="http://bluediamondtours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_0972-e1470828617478-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_0972" width="225" height="300" />

While waiting for the tide to change, what better place to relax in than a vineyard?Â  Spectacular views, superb wines and a joyful atmosphere.Â  Life is good in Nova Scotia.

The second day of our adventure took us to the Annapolis Valley.Â  Beginning at Hallâ€™s Harbour, we walked on the empty harbour floor, knowing in a few hours, this would be completely filled by the Bay (the days tidal range was 39.6ft).

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-487" src="http://bluediamondtours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0900-e1469794666407-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_0900" width="225" height="300" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-488" src="http://bluediamondtours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0902-e1469794688876-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_0902" width="225" height="300" />

Leaving the harbour, we visited Grand Pre to learn the sad story of the Acadian Expulsion then headed to the Gaspereau Valley to visit Lucketts Vineyards.Â  Not only did we enjoy the fine food and spectacular scenery, Pete Luckett was on hand to answer questions and tell us his story.
