These are just a few of the many <em>golden treasures of touring in Nova Scotia</em>, and many would say too few or this or that should have been included. Truthfully, there are just too many treasures awaiting discovery here in New Scotland.

Equally true, that each time we travel and tour through Nova Scotia, we discover <em>new</em><em> to us </em> places, sites or activities that add to our Nova Scotia Travel Experience, and get incorporated into future tours.

You can too, whether you travel on your own or on/with a trip arranged by a firm like ours, you will discover a new nugget, to the scenic wonder that is Nova Scotia. Be it, the hidden corners of historic Halifax, the little known beaches through-out the province, or the beat of our music; Celtic Colours International in Cape Breton in early October, the Atlantic Jazz Festival, in mid July in Halifax or the Acadian Festival at Church Point, music abounds through out the province - just waiting for you.

From Shag Harbour to Cape North the ‚Äúhidden treasures ‚Äù of Nova Scotia await your arrival.¬† Let <em>your</em> trip of discovery begin.
