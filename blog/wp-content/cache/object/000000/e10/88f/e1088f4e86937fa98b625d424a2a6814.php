Beginning in the Port City, we enjoyed a peaceful stroll around Halifax Public Gardens, which truly is a splendid sight at this time of year, full of colour and scents.Â  A short drive took us to Citadel Hill allowing for stunning views of the city and where we could witness the noon-gun salute.Â  Our guests also enjoyed some great meals in the downtown area and even managed to find copies of their immigration papers at Pier 21!

We had absolutely gorgeous weather to explore the Eastern Shore!Â  Beginning with a stroll on the Dartmouth Waterfront we then cruised along the shoreline to visit the Fishermanâ€™s Life Museum and took a step back in time at Memory Lane Village.

An early morning departure from the city took us to Peggyâ€™s Cove, where we enjoyed breakfast on the rocks before meandering along the coastline to the quaint fishing village of Lunenburg.Â Â  Then to a very different fishing village on the other side of the Province, Hallâ€™s Harbour.Â  Here, we could witness the glory of the Bay of Fundy and the dramatic difference in the high and low tides.

While waiting for the tide to change, what better place to relax in than a vineyard?Â  Spectacular views, superb wines and a joyful atmosphere.Â  Life is good in Nova Scotia.
