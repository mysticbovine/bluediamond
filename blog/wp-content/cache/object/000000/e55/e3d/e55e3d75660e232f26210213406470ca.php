On arrival at Halls Harbour, the tide was almost “dead low” – perfect to compare with the high tide later in the day.  Next stop on our itinerary was the Blomidon Look-Off - unfortunately "Mother-Nature" didn’t want to cooperate and blanketed the "look-off" with heavy fog!

We meandered down the mountain, through the town of Wolfville to view “the Landscapes of Grand Pre".  The professors took a "class picture"  . . . everyone was in great spirits!  Although closed, we visited Grand Pre National Historic site and toured the grounds before heading back to Wolfville to lunch at Joe's Food Emporium.

Immediately following lunch, someone suggested we stop for an ice cream at Hennigars  (Oh yes - that was me!). As always, this stop was a big hit, as was our next stop at Planter's Ridge Winery.  They sampled three of the winery’s finest offerings and about a dozen bottles later, "climbed aboard the bus".

Leaving Planter's, our next destination was back to the Look-Off where hopefully Mother Nature would cooperate this time!  We passed by freshly plowed fields and on into Canning and then . . . the bus broke down!

The student's took it in their stride - they made lemonade from "the lemon"!  They played games, socialized and walked to Canning's Shipyard Park to await the arrival of a replacement bus.  It took about two hours for the bus to arrive from Halifax, fortunately weather-wise the sun was shining and the temperature was on the "mild-side".

Once on the replacement bus, the decision was made to return to Halifax.  Unfortunately they never did get to see high tide in Halls Harbour.  Perhaps next time.

What a super group and great sports they all were!
