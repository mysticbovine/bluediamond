As we drove through Halifax, we passed the Cathedral Church of All Saints and couldnâ€™t resist popping in for a quick look â€“ Beautiful!Â  The weather was gorgeous so a stroll around the Halifax Public Gardens was definitely in order prior to visiting the Citadel for the noon gun saluteâ€¦.and to hear the pipe band.

We headed to the shoreline for the afternoon to explore the quaint fishing village of West Dover, the Swiss Air Memorial and finally Peggyâ€™s Cove.

The second day of our adventure took us to the Annapolis Valley.Â  Beginning at Hallâ€™s Harbour, we walked on the empty harbour floor, knowing in a few hours, this would be completely filled by the Bay (the days tidal range was 39.6ft).

Leaving the harbour, we visited Grand Pre to learn the sad story of the Acadian Expulsion then headed to the Gaspereau Valley to visit Lucketts Vineyards.Â  Not only did we enjoy the fine food and spectacular scenery, Pete Luckett was on hand to answer questions and tell us his story.

We returned to Hallâ€™s Harbour to find the tides had come in and dramatically changed the scenery.Â  The phenomenal Bay of Fundy never ceases to amaze my visitors or me.
