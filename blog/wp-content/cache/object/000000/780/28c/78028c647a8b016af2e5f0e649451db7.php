The Bay of Fundy and its extreme tidal range has been very popular, especially from Hallâ€™s Harbourâ€¦that may also have something to do with the scenic drive, temptation of lobster and so much to do and experience in between tides.Â  From stepping back in time and experiencing Grand Pre, taking in spectacular vistas to sampling superb wines at Planters Ridge Winery and munching on cheese at Fox Hill Cheese House.

It was an absolute delight to have a 3yr old on one of our trips â€“ reminded me of why I am so happy to be a Grandfather!Â  So much energy and so much fun but they go home with the parents at the end of the day;)Â  Truthfully, the wee fella made my day â€“ what fun he was.Â  Our trip was apparently the high-light for him:

â€œObviously you made our day balanced. He is a super busy boy all the time. Max cried on Sunday on our way home, that he doesn't want to leave Halifax. Tim said that this Sat trip was the highlight of the entire 3 day visit.â€Â  Words we love to hear!

So to our Ontario friends, thank you for visiting and I do hope we see you again!
