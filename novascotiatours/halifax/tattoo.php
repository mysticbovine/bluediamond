						<h2>DAY 1: </h2>
						<p>Arrive Halifax International Airport and on to your hotel  (located in the centre of Halifax's urban night-life!).  On your own for the balance of day one.  There is always much to experience at night  in Halifax!</p>
						<h2>DAY 2: </h2>
						<p>After breakfast, depart for <strong>Peggy's Shores DayTrip</strong>.  Return to Halifax in time for dinner and  after dinner activities.</p>
						<h2>DAY 3: </h2>
						<p>After breakfast, depart for <strong>Evangeline's Acadia DayTrip</strong>.  Return to Halifax in time for dinner and  after dinner experiences.</p>
						<h2>DAY 4:</h2>
						<p>Today we tour Warden  of the North - Halifax.  After an early dinner, we'll have a backstage  tour of the Tattoo, followed by the performance of <em>the  Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo</em>.  Return to hotel.  The Tattoo runs from July 1 to  July 7 each year. If your trip is at a different time, we will substitute  another daytrip for this day.</p>
						<h2>DAY 5: </h2>
						<p>Today, after breakfast we'll explore the Goldcoast as far as  Sherbrooke, Nova Scotia.  Dinner will be  at Liscombe Lodge and then return to Halifax.</p>
						<h2>DAY 6:</h2>
						<p>Following an early breakfast, we'll head to New Brunswick and  it's World Lobster Capital - Shediac! Captain Eric LeBlanc of Lobster Tales  will take us out into Shediac Bay for a three hour plus educational lobster  tour.  We'll learn &lsquo;all there is know'  about lobster, from their life-cycle, to how to catch them (including a live  demonstration) and how to cook and eat them.   This includes a freshly-cooked lobster dinner.  Departing Shediac (after our group photo)  we'll visit Magnetic Hill (also a &lsquo;snack meal' stop) before departing back to  Halifax.  Please note, we can again make  a substitution by including in <strong>Day One</strong> a Lobster Fishing  Adventure at Lunenburg. </p>
						<h2>DAY 7: </h2>
						<p>Following breakfast, any activities will depend on the flight  time for your journey home. Hotel, meals are not part of this package.  If you wish us to do so, we will arrange for  hotel, meals, a harbour dinner cruise, sea-kayaking, golf and other items  including arranging for tickets to special activities taking place at the time  you will be in Halifax. </p>
						
						<p><strong>With Blue Diamond Excursions and Tours: </strong></p>
						<ul>
						  <li>We tailor your excursion to fulfill your specific requests /  requirements.        </li>
						  <li>We can and will alter <strong><u>any</u></strong> itinerary to include  what you want to do and see. Your excursion is just that; your excursion, so  while we offer a variety of itineraries / experiences to choose from, they all  can be tailored to suit your tastes and wishes.</li>
						  <li>As with snowflakes, no two tours are ever exactly the same,  there's a personal touch added to each trip.   Our tours are not of the &lsquo;cookie cutter' variety - we're &lsquo;home-made' and  unique!</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Your excursion party is just you. No strangers or large  crowds!  <em>The  focus remains on you</em> not the itinerary, clock, or  on people you don't know.  As the  itinerary is your own, it is flexible too.   We use the time of your excursion to do and see the things you want to  do and see!  This is your tour / your  vacation, and we want to make it special for you with memories that will last a  lifetime! </p>

								<p class="lead ">Bob, I want to thank you for the great tour you gave us to Peggy's Cove.  It was a great day, and we were so pleased with the services you provided.  I have already had an opportunity to recommend you to someone else and will continue to do so.</p>
