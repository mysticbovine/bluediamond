							<h2>Point Pleasant Park</h2>
							<p>Departing<b></b>from your hotel we'll head to
							beautiful <b>Point Pleasant Park</b> on the Halifax peninsula where your guide
							will give aninformative talk<b> </b>regarding the past and present of
							this historic area of Halifax.</p>
							
							<p><img src="../../images/halifax/citadel.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="A member of the 78th Highlanders stands at the entrance of the Citadel in Halifax, Nova Scotia."></p>
							<h2>South-End &amp; Northwest Arm</h2>
							<p>Leaving the park, we'll drive through the expensive residential
							area along the non-commercial part of Halifax Harbour known as the Northwest
							Arm, pass by two major local universities, St. Mary's and Dalhousie on our
							way to <b>Halifax Public Gardens</b>. Enjoy a stroll through the finest
							example of formal Victoria Gardens to be found in North America and perhaps
							sample hand-paddled ice cream while relaxing in this beauty spot.</p>

							<p>Following our walk, we'll drive to the "top of Halifax" for a
							spectacular photo opportunity at <b>Halifax Citadel</b>. The Citadel is
							the reason for the founding of Halifax in 1749.</p>

							
							<h2>Historic Core &amp; the Titanic</h2>

							<p>As we leave the Citadel and meander down to the harbour, we will
							pass a number of historic sites along the way. Our route will take us by
							the naval dockyard area, under both Harbour bridges and past the site of
							the <b>1917 Halifax Explosion,</b>on our way to visit the<b>Titanic
							Cemetery</b>. Here, you will see the grave sites (and perhaps hear some
							stories) of the Titanic victims and learn of the Halifax connection to this
							1912 maritime tragedy.</p>

							<p><img src="../../images/halifax/dingle-dusk.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="The Dingle Tower at dusk."></p>
							<h2>The Place Where Time Began</h2>

							<p>Following a refreshment stop, we'll make our way to the
							"place where time began", passing by the only remnant of the <i>Mont
							Blanc</i>, one of two ships involved in the 1917 Halifax explosion.
							Following a brief stroll,we'll make our way to the area of the first
							White Star Line disaster. </p>

							<p>The White Star's luxury steamship <i>S.S. Atlantic</i> ran
							into Mar's Head at Lower Prospect on April 1, 1873 - It appears April
							was an unlucky month for the White Star Line! This was the worst single
							vessel disaster to occur in Canadian waters prior to the Titanic. Five
							hundred and sixty-two people lost their lives that day, but 390 were saved due
							to the efforts of the local fishermen and their families.</p>

							<p>We'll visit the <b>Interpretation Center</b>, the mass burial site, stroll the
							boardwalk which wraps around the coastline, and perhaps rest at the gazebo to
							bask in the magnificent view. Prior to leaving, we'll tour this <b>scenic
							and authentic fishing community</b>.
							</p>
							<p><img src="../../images/halifax/westdover.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="An aerial view of West Dover, Nova Scotia, Canada."></p>
							<p>We'll stop in <b>West Dover</b> for lunch (at your own
							expense) in a restaurant which one of our guests remarked "has good food,
							scenery and prices!" While in this fishing community, we'll stroll along
							the wharf and savor the panoramic view of Peggy's Cove and the gorgeous
							coastline.</p>

							<p>As we near <b>Peggy's Cove</b>, you'll experience the
							dramatic changing topography and enjoy numerousvistas of the Atlantic
							Ocean and its scenic inlet's and coves. We'll spend some time exploring
							the "most visited place in Canada" and two other nearby attractions, the
							"swimming hole" and "deGarth Memorial".</p>

							<p><img src="../../images/halifax/peggys.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Peggy's Cove Lighthouse at sunset."></p>
							<h2>St. Margaret's Bay</h2>

							<p>Our return route will take us along the shoreline of historic
							Saint Margaret's Bay, an area noted for its stories of religion, rum-running,
							bootlegging and connection to NASA, just to name a few! We'll stop for
							photo opportunities at <b>Hackett's Cove</b> and <i>if you wish</i>,
							visit the Swiss AirFlight 111 Memorial.</p>

							<h2>Return to your hotel</h2>

							<p>We'll to return to your hotel via a different route with, if time
							allows, a brief stop at an Acadian Maple Productretail store so you can
							find the perfect gift to take home.</p>
