								<p class="lead ">A quick note to tell you THANKS for a wonderful tour on behalf of my group.
								So many kept telling me how much they enjoyed your knowledge and sharing of it with us. I see the passion your have rather than just the job. We have had lots of guides that talk just to be talking but not really sharing such great info as you.</p>
