We invite you to come with us from Halifax to the "Gentle Island", Prince Edward Island where you can see production of wool being woven into blankets and other uses. A breathtaking destination, filled with wandering trails, endless beaches and unique experiences everywhere you look. Let us take you on a trip of Mills, Alpacas, Quiltmakers, Lighthouses, Sheep and beautiful red sand beaches.</p>

              <h3>Day 1 - Halifax to Brudenell</h3>
 
                <p>Following breakfast, we leave Halifax and head to Prince Edward Island via the Northumberland Ferry.  Enjoy a relaxing trip across the Strait, have an ice cream cone and take in the lovely view from the observation decks, and watch the intriguing programming the ferry service provides.  Our home for the next two nights is the Rodd Brudenell Resort.</p>
                <img src="../../images/pei/pins/image001.png" class="img-rounded">
                  
                <h3>Day 2</h3>
                <p>We leave Cardigan and travel through the Caledonia hills towards the historic community of Belfast, settled originally by Scots in 1803.  Fleece and Harmony is owned by two sisters who not only raise the sheep you see in the fields, but also spin the wool in their on-site mill, and dye it using organic dyes.  You can see the work in progress from their well- appointed shop.  (Insider hint – they carry some of the best knitting needles ever!)</p>
                 
                <p>We'll leave Belfast to head to the historic lighthouse at Point Prim.  There we'll have lunch in the charming seaside café overlooking Hillsborough Bay.</p>
                
                <img src="../../images/pei/pins/image003.png" class="img-rounded">
                <p>Belfast Mini Mills is a fascinating business which manufactures small woolen mills that are in use around the world.  They also have a charming barnyard with lots of sheep and some interesting breeds of chickens.  When you pull into the yard, you'll often see brightly coloured yarn drying in the Island sun.</p>
                
                <img src="../../images/pei/pins/image005.png" class="img-rounded">
                <p>They offer felting sessions where you turn their multicoloured roving's into your own work of art.  There is also a well-stocked yarn shop featuring an extremely interesting variety of wools, as well as presents to take home to the non-knitters in the family.</p>
                 
                 
                <h3>Day 3</h3>
                <p>We'll depart Cardigan for Pastimes Rug Hooking in Vernon, keeping an eye out for the Amish farmers who live along Route 3.  This is a family-owned business which highlights traditional wool hooking techniques and carries a variety of canvases, kits, and hooks for the hookers in the group.</p>
                <p>We'll then make a stop at The Quilting Bee located on the outskirts of Charlottetown to check out their supply of jelly rolls, fat quarters, and interesting fabrics.</p>
                <p>No trip to Prince Edward Island is complete without a visit to iconic Green Gables. 
                <p>From there, will head to Carr's Oyster Bar for a late lunch on the side of New London Bay.  Save room for dessert because we'll drop into Village Pottery in New London for ice cream from Potter's Parlour and end the day at Trailside Yarn in Kensington.</p>
                <img src="../../images/pei/pins/image007.png" class="img-rounded"> 
                
                <h3>Day 4 </h3>
                <p>Today we'll visit MacAusland's Woolen Mill in Bloomfield which is an Island institution when it comes to yarn and woolen blankets.  (Hint they sell mill ends which are often big enough to be used as a comfy lap rug at a very reasonable cost.)
                Lunch today will be at the award-winning Mill River Resort.  Chef Stephen Wilson is one of the Island's finest (and has won the prestigious Burger Month award – check out the burgers on the menu.)</p>
                <p>Then we'll head to Green Gables Alpacas in Birch Hill to see these South American wool-bearing animals.  Their wool is amazing – lightweight yet warm.  This shop is your source for alpaca socks, insoles, custom yarns.
                We'll return to Summerside for free time exploring the seaside city.</p>
                 <img src="../../images/pei/pins/image009.png" class="img-rounded">
                <h3>Day 5</h3>
                <p>We leave Prince Edward Island via the iconic Confederation Bridge.  But there's one more treat in store. We'll drop into Deanne Fitzpatrick's shop in Amherst.  She's a world-renowned author and expert in the art of rug hooking.
                Our final stop will be at Masstown Market before heading back to Halifax.</p>
