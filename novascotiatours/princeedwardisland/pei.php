							<em>Prince Edward Island(PEI)</em> is Canada's smallest and  greenest province. Cradled on the waves of <em>The Gulf of St. Lawrence</em>,  the island is known for the vivid colours of its gently rolling  landscape. The island is surrounded by miles of sandy beaches and red  sandstone cliffs and is perfectly sized for touring. Our small group bus and  coach tours to PEI will give you an experience you simply can't get from a  typical tour groups.</p>

Once we arrive in PEI, we'll explore part of the eastern area  of the province including Murray River and Harbour, Montague (via Route 319)  and Brudenell before going on to Charlottetown. It's lobster for dinner  tonight! </p>

							<h3>Day Two</h3>
							<p>Following breakfast at our hotel, we'll tour Charlottetown, known as <em>The</em> <em>Cradle of Confederation</em>. We'll also visit <em>Province House (</em>where  Confederation was conceived), and explore <em>Founder's Hall </em>where we'll  learn all about Confederation. Next, it's a drive through the<em> UPEI</em> campus, Experimental Farm area and more. Then we're off to the Cavendish  area of the province, known as <em>Anne of Green Gables </em>country. Lunch  today will be on your own at PEI Preserves where the restaurant and 'jam-making  facilities' are housed in an old butter factory.</p>
							<p> We will tour the national historic site, <em>Anne of Green Gables House </em>and  explore / tour part of the Central Coastal Drive, including a visit to Malpeque  Harbour and Bay (famous for oysters). We'll visit Saint Mary's Church  which is the largest 'single-style' church on the island. PEI has  approximately 250 churches which is more per capita than any other province in  Canada. Dinner tonight will be at a nearby restaurant. </p>

							<h3>Day Three</h3>
							
							<p>After breakfast, we'll explore <em>western Prince Edward Island</em>.  Stops today will include:</p>

We'll stop at Saint Simon &amp; Saint Jude Church which is the largest church  in PEI and home to the oldest and one of only four existing <strong><em>Louis  Mitchell Tracker Organs.</em></strong> Lunch today is on your own at Cape  North, which as the name suggest, is the most northern point of the  island.
