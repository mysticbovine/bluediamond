								<h2>October 7: Cape Breton Bound</h2>

								<p>
								Following the main highway to Cape Breton, we'll travel across
								the Canso Causeway - a 1,385 m rock-filled roadway crossing the Strait of
								Canso, stopping on the other side at the Cove Motel Restaurant for lunch…and
								super views of the Causeway.</p>

								<p>
								Following a scenic trailway, we'll head to the Inverary Resort
								which is where we'll be staying for the next three nights. Take some time
								to relax, explore Baddeck and have dinner in one of the local
								restaurants.</p>

								<p><b>CONCERT: 7:30 PM</b></p>

								<p><img src="../../images/capebreton/distillery.jpg" alt="Distillery with a mountain in the background cover in fall leaves." class="img-thumbnail"></p>
								<h2>October 8: Celtic sounds</h2>

								<p>
								Following breakfast, we'll meander our way to Judique to visit
								the Celtic Music Interpretive Centre.  Explore the centre and our Celtic
								musical heritage then enjoy a ‘lunch time ceilidh'.</p>

								<p>
								If time allows, we'll visit a true Cape Breton gem – the Glenora
								Inn and Distillery. Enjoy a wee dram and listen to some live music while
								basking in the glory of the surrounding scenery – it's sure to take your breath
								away!</p>

								<p>
								We'll relax for the afternoon in Inverness and take in a Celtic
								Colours concert.</p>

								<p><b>CONCERT:  2 PM</b></p>

								<p>
								Following the afternoon concert, we'll return to Baddeck for
								dinner and prepare for our evening concert.</p>

								<p><b>CONCERT:  7:30 PM</b></p>

								<h2>October 9: Marconi Trail</h2>

								<p>
								Our first stop of the morning will be at the National Historic
								Site, Fortress Louisburg. During your visit, you will find costumed animators
								portraying residents of 1744. Period costumes and exhibits line the streets and
								along the busy waterfront. See how the wealthy elite lived, contrasting to the
								very different life experienced by the poor. </p>

								<p>
								We'll be lunching in Louisbourg, so bring your appetite to one
								of the 18th-century restaurants. The food is fresh and plentiful, the recipes
								are from the 18th-century and the atmosphere is New France in the New World!
								</p>

								<p>
								Travelling through some spectacular scenery, we'll head to Glace
								Bay to visit the Miners Museum, home of 'Men of the Deeps'. We'll tour this
								mine, take a trip underground and learn first-hand, from miners themselves,
								what this harsh life was like.</p>

								<p>
								Dinner will be in Sydney at a restaurant of your choosing,
								following which, we'll attend a Celtic Colours concert. </p>

								<p><b>CONCERT:  7:30 PM</b></p>

								
								<p><img src="../../images/capebreton/ebwinery.jpg" alt="Winery with a majestic view of the numerous small islands in the Bras d'Or Lakes." class="img-thumbnail"></p>
								<h2>October 10: Homeward Bound</h2>

								<p>
								No visit to Baddeck would be complete without visiting the
								Alexander Graham Bell Museum, which is where our first stop today will be,
								before heading to Cape Bretons only winery, Eileanan Brèagha Winery.</p>

								<p>
								As Nova Scotia's northernmost estate winery, Eileanan Brèagha
								(Scottish Gaelic for beautiful islands), the vineyard was named in homage to
								the owner's Gaelic heritage and for the majestic view of the numerous small
								islands in the Bras d'Or Lakes. Enjoy, what has been said to be, &quot;the most
								stunning vineyard vista in the Province&quot; with a little island in every
								glass!&quot;</p>

								<p>
								Wine making in Cape Breton is relatively new, but tea drinking
								is a long standing tradition! We'll pop into Rita MacNeils Tea room to enjoy
								some true island tea hospitality. We'll continue on to St. Peter's, where we'll
								cross St Peter's Canal - the only functioning lock system in Nova Scotia.</p>

								<p>
								Once again, we'll cross the Canso Causeway back onto the
								mainland and head for home. Hoarse from singing and toe-tapped out, we
								won't be offended if you doze off on our return journey. </p>

								<p>
								Each evening, during Celtic Colours, an after-hours (11pm) party
								is held at Colaisde Na Gàidhlig / The Gaelic College, St. Ann's, which the
								hotel offers a shuttlebus service to and from – if you choose to do this, it
								will be at your own expense. </p>
