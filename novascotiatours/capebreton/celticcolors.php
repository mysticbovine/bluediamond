							</p>For nine days in October, Cape Breton Island is home to a unique celebration of music and culture as the Celtic Colours International Festival presents dozens of concerts at locations all over the island, an extensive line-up of workshops, a visual art series of exhibitions, and a nightly Festival Club. Over the years, artists have traveled from near and far to join the finest of Cape Breton's musicians, singers, dancers, storytellers and tradition-bearers for the annual autumn celebration.</p>

							<p>One of the things that sets Celtic Colours apart is that it isn't limited to just one location. Communities all over Cape Breton Island host concerts and workshops at a time when the fall leaves are at their most brilliant, and traveling around the island offers one breathtaking view after another. These communities are the places where the culture has been nurtured for over 200 years providing context for the roots of the music, and celebrating each community's contribution to our living Celtic culture.</p>

							<p>In many of these communities, the local fire hall, parish hall or community centre has hosted musical events for generations, in some cases, literally moving the fire trucks out of the hall to accommodate a dance. Venues for Celtic Colours vary from an 18th century reconstructed French Chapel to brand new state of the art performance facilities to community halls, but all venues share in common the prominent place each holds in the community it serves.</p>

							<p>The Celtic culture of music, dance and storytelling lives on in these communities and provides the foundation for the celebration of living culture that is the Celtic Colours International Festival.</p>
							<p>With an ambitious schedule (as many as six concerts each day), it is simply impossible to see and hear everything. The organizers of the Festival realize this and take special care in the programming of each show so that it is possible to get a taste of all that the Festival has to offer on any given day. Whether you're interested in Gaelic singing, Cape Breton fiddling, local dance traditions, outstanding accordion playing, or an afternoon of world-class bagpiping, Celtic Colours allows for festival-goers to tailor their musical experience to suit their tastes.</p>
							<p>Blue Diamond Tours is pleased to offer a touring service from Halifax to Baddeck, the focal point of this annual festival.</p>
