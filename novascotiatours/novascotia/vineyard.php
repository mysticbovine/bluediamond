							<p>Despite the unlikely grape-growing climate, over the last 30 years, vineyards and wineries have been popping up across the Province, many of which have gained international recognition and produce award winning wines.  </p>

							<p><strong>Sainte-Famille Wines</strong> is a small, family-owned winery located on an old, Acadian settlement overlooking the picturesque Avon River Valley. We'll stroll through the scenic vineyard, tour the winery and sample a selection of their wines, perhaps pairing with local cheese for a true Nova Scotian taste.</p>

							<p>Our next stop will be at the oldest winery in Nova Scotia, <strong>Domaine De Grand Pr&eacute;</strong>. This gorgeous winery not only produces award winning wines but also boasts an award winning restaurant!  With the Bay of Fundy as a back drop, explore this beautiful vineyard, tour their wine museum then sit back, sip and savour the flavours of their superb wine and cuisine.</p>

							<p>As we leave this part of the Annapolis Valley, we'll pass through the quaint university town of Wolfville and take a scenic, country road to <strong>Gaspereau Vineyards</strong>.  This small, boutique winery showcases some of the best wines Nova Scotia has to offer. Once a dairy farm and apple orchard, this 50 acre property has been transformed into a vineyard and passionately producing top quality wines ever since.</p>

							<p>Following Gaspereau winery, we'll return to your ship at the Pavilion in Halifax.</p>

							<p>As with all our excursions and tours, the Vineyard Adventures itinerary can be modified in a number of ways, for example:</p>
							<ul>
								   <li>Visit one vineyard and Grand Pr&eacute; National Historic Site;</li>
								   <li>Combine a visit to Grand Pr&eacute;, a vineyard, a cheese farm, and the Blomidon Look-Off;</li>
								   <li>Visit one, two, or three different vineyards other than those mentioned above;</li>
								   <li>Combine a visit to a vineyard, museum and Hall's Harbour.</li>
							</ul>
								   <h4>The combinations are endless!  Contact us today to plan your custom vineyard adventure!<h4>
