						<h2><strong>Ancient Coastlines</strong></h2>
						<p><img src="../../images/btdcollection/ancient.jpg" alt="Riding the Fundy tidal bore" class="img-thumbnail" align="right" /></p>
						<p>Ride the Bay of Fundy tidal bore in a zodiac.  It's a wild, wet, fun ride and an amazing experience...and also one the best ways to view and this extraordinary coastline
						</p>
						<p>We can visit a world famous fossil and gemstone museum (A UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site) and learn the historical and geographical significance of this unique area of Nova Scotia.  Enjoy a guided walk along the Fundy shores where we may find semi-precious gemstones or equally interesting, fossils - a major find could fully pay for the entire trip!</p>
						<p>Lunch with the locals.  Chat and learn about their history and struggle to survive in this area of Nova Scotia - you're in maple-sugar country so it is likely one or more maple products will be on the menu.</p>

						<p><a name="acadia" id="acadia"></a></p>
						<h2>Evangeline's Acadia</h2>
						<p><img src="../../images/btdcollection/EvangelinesAcadia.jpg" alt="Evangeline's Acadia" class="img-thumbnail" align="right" /></p>
						<p>Lunch with the locals.  Chat and learn about their history and struggle to survive in this area of Nova Scotia - you're in maple-sugar country so it is likely one or more maple products will be on the menu.</p>
						<p>The Annapolis Valley is home to numerous wineries so a visit to a local winery is a must.  This is a relatively new and important industry in this region of Nova Scotia and the choices are numerous.</p>
						<p>Lunch is Lobster in the Rough served amid lobster traps, fishing boats and whirling seagulls - a true Nova Scotia experience and a meal to remember!  The distinctive locale will encourage you to use your camera!</p>
						<p>A guided trek (about six hours in over-all time) will take you to one of the most unique settings in the province to view the immense expanse and power of Fundy's tides - if the hike is timed correctly, you may also hear the pure strength and force of the water travelling up the Bay of Fundy!   As you stroll along this nature trail and preserve, enjoy the distinctive flora, fauna and wildlife of the Fundy region.  </p>
						<p>The trek can be included in a daytrip or for something less strenuous, we might visit the former residence of Nova Scotia's Charles Ramage Prescott and learn about his many contributions to Nova Scotia's agricultural heritage or perhaps visit a cheese farm and enjoy some tasty samples</p>
						<p>There will be time to stop at one of the area's famous, breathtaking 'look-offs' prior to our return to Halifax in time for your evening meal!</p>

						<p><a name="goldcoast" id="goldcoast"></a></p>
						<h2>The Gold Coast</h2>
						<p><img src="../../images/btdcollection/Goldcoast.jpg" alt="Halifax waterfront" class="img-thumbnail" align="right" /></p>
						<p>Breakfast near a famous locale of Halifax harbour; learn of its connection to the U.S. Civil War and the C.S.S. Tallahassee; and enjoy a stroll along the ocean-side boardwalk.</p>
						<p>We'll visit the Fisherman's Museum - just how does one raise 13 daughters in a tiny household? Learn how difficult it was it for the 'Gold Coasters' to earn their daily bread.</p>
						<p>Explore a typical 19th century Nova Scotia coastal town - a preserved village on the Gold Coast - see how they lived and loved in the days gone by.  We'll have lunch with the locals - meet and mingle and find out first-hand about life on the Gold Coast.</p>
						<p>Dinner will be taken at one of Nova Scotia's finest hostelries - there'll be time for a stroll along one of several nature walks which start/finish at this resort or some may prefer to go canoeing or kayaking prior to dinner.  Dinner will be from a wonderful menu with specialities including planked salmon.</p>

						<h2><strong>Northumberland Highland Seaside</strong></h2>
						<p><img src="../../images/btdcollection/norththumberland.jpg" alt="Northumberland Highland village" class="img-thumbnail" align="right" /></p>
						<p>We'll begin at a museum to learn about Nova Scotia's pre-Confederation industrial past, from steam engines to coal mining, take a stroll back in time. </p>
						<p>Heading to the coastline, enjoy dockside learning of our highland heritage and visit the Ship 'Hector' - the vessel displaced highlanders arrived on in 1773 in search of a better life in Nova Scotia.</p>
						<p>A jaunt along the Northumberland coastline will take us to the warmest salt waters north of Virginia!  Superb vistas of PEI, gorgeous beaches and beautiful scenery abound. We'll travel on scenic back roads and byways to visit a 19th century, operating, water-powered grist mill tucked in away in a picturesque gorge.</p>
						<p>Prior to returning to Halifax, we'll have one last stop at a vineyard and winery to enjoy their offerings, reflect and relax after a wonderful day out.</p>
						<p>We'll be back in Halifax by 6:00 pm in time for dinner and evening activities</p>
		
						<p><a name="peggys" id="peggys"></a></p>
						<h2>Peggy's Shores</h2>
						<p><img src="../../images/btdcollection/Peggy1.jpg" alt="The famouse Peggy's Cove lighthouse"  class="img-thumbnail" align="right" /></p>
						<p>We'll head for breakfast and exploration of Peggy's Cove - a world famous scenic and geological wonder of the world. As we tour along St. Margaret's Bay, we'll also visit the Swiss Air Flight 111 Memorial and Internment site which is a very peaceful, beautiful memorial.  Weather permitting, we'll also stroll along some of the gorgeous beaches in this area.</p>
						<p>Lunch will be your choice in one of the many, superb eateries in Chester.  Chester is a 19th century resort village (similar in conception to Bar Harbor, Maine) with quaint shops, dining rooms and fine old/new mansions scattered throughout this delightful community.</p>
						<p>After lunch, we'll head to Mahone Bay where you can view one of the most iconic Nova Scotian images: the Three Churches. Mahone Bay is a wonderful, quaint, south shore seaside village also known for its handicraft and artisan shops - explore the Main Street and find your treasure.</p>
						<p>No visit would be complete without a stop in Lunenburg; the "fishing capital of the world" and a United Nations (UNESCO) world heritage site featuring distinctive architecture, shops, restaurants and inns. It is also home to Nova Scotia's Fisherman's Museum and the famous Blue Nose II. Lunenburg may well be an ideal place for that lobster dinner you've have been craving!</p>
						
						<p><a name="Tatamagouche" id="Tatamagouche"></a></p>
						<h2>Tatamagouche</h2>
						<p><img src="../../images/btdcollection/tatamagouche.jpg" alt="Brook in Tatamagouche"  class="img-thumbnail" align="right" /></p>
						<p>This small community has so much to offer, a day-trip from Halifax really cannot do it justice, but we’ll  (mightily) try….</p>
						<p>Upon arrival in this quaint little village, we suggest first visiting the The Tipperary Bakery & Café, sampling their coffee and baked delights and then decide how best to spend your time.  You can shop, dine, play a street piano, visit museums or stroll along the waters edge trail.  A short drive will take you to amazing beaches, spectacular scenery, golf courses, open farms and vineyards. The choice is yours.</p>
						<p>Tatamagouche has a “Road Train” which is free of charge (donations accepted) and is a super way to see and learn about this delightful little village…and a quirky way to “get around”.  If you’re feeling somewhat energetic, why not rent a buggy or quadricycle (pedal powered bikes) and explore the area?</p>
						<p>Tatamagouche is home to some super, unique stores so a little “retail therapy” should be included on your agenda.  A visit to Creamery Square is a must!  Learn about Anne Swan - a local “Giantess”, check out the fossil collection and creamery exhibit or research your ancestors…there is something here for everyone.</p>
						<p>Although small, a mighty array of eateries is available in Tata.  From a local Chowder House or pub to rail-car dining; dining in Tatamagouche is an experience not to be missed!  They even have their own brewery, The Tatamagouche Brewery!  Pop in for a sample and raise a glass to “Pure Tatamagoodness.”</p>
						<p>There are also many attractions in the nearby vicinity, some of which are listed below.  Ask us how we can include them into your trip!</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Caldera Distilling</li>
							<li>Grist Mill</li>
							<li>Jost Winery</li>
							<li>Lismore Sheep Farm</li>
							<li>Rushtons Beach</li>
							<li>Seafoam Lavender Company & Gardens</li>
							<li>Sugar Moon Farm</li>
							<li>The Pork Shop</li>
						</ul>
						<p>We suggest this tour (should be) an early departure from Halifax so (we can include time for) breakfast, lunch and dinner!</p>

						<h2>Warden of the North - Halifax</h2>
						<p><img src="../../images/btdcollection/WardenoftheNorth.jpg" alt="Soldiers on the parade ground" class="img-thumbnail" align="right" /></p>
						<p>We'll tour the historical core of this famous city including a guided tour of the Citadel - one of Canada's most visited National Historic sites. Originally built in 1749, work began to rebuild this "star-shaped fortress" in 1826 but wasn't completed until 1856. It is the true heart and raison d'etre of this ancient port city.</p>
						<p>We'll tour York Redoubt at the harbour's mouth - part of the defenses of the port since the city's founding in 1749.</p>
						<p>You'll have time to stroll the beautiful Public Gardens - the finest example of formal Victorian Gardens in North America! Dating from 1843, but somewhat cruelly ravaged by nature (Hurricane Juan in 2003), the gardens have been restored beyond their original splendor.</p>
						<p>We'll visit the Titanic Cemetery, where we can remember those who were lost in one of the most notorious maritime disasters in modern history.</p>	
						<p>A short drive will take us to two architecturally important sub-divisions in old Halifax - The area around Richmond in north-end Halifax and the site of Halifax's defining moment, the December 1917 Explosion.  The Halifax Explosion gave us the title 'Shattered City' and was the greatest man-made explosion prior to the Atomic Bomb in 1945.  We'll learn why these areas are an important part of our history.</p>
						<p>We'll visit the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic where you can learn more about Halifax, the Titanic, the 1917 Explosion and our connection to the sea.  This museum contains a wealth of information and artifacts related to seafaring over the centuries and our beloved city.</p>
						<p>We can also visit Fisherman's Cove and the Eastern Passage area near the mouth of Halifax harbour - an area closely tied to the U.S. Civil War and the C.S.S. Tallahassee.</p>
						<p>We'll be back at your hotel or restaurant in time for dinner</p>
