              <h3>Day 0 </h3>

<p>Given your flight time and arrival we will arrange your driver/guide or one of our staff to pick you up from the Halifax International Air Port or the Via Rail Station in Halifax if you are planning to arrive by rail and comfortable shuttle you to your accommodations in the heart of downtown Halifax. Following a brief orientation of the surrounding area we'll bid you goodnight for a full day of touring the next morning. </p>

<img src="../../images/novascotia/oldscotland/oldscotland1.jpg" class="img-rounded">

<h3>Day 1</h3> 

<p>Departing from your hotel we'll make our way to the area of the first White Star Line disaster.

<p>The White Star's luxury steamship S.S. Atlantic ran into Mar's Head at Lower Prospect on April 1, 1873 - It appears April was an unlucky month for the White Star Line! This was the worst single vessel disaster to occur in Canadian waters prior to the Titanic. Five hundred and sixty-two people lost their lives that day, but 390 were saved due to the efforts of the local fishermen and their families.</p>

<p>As we continue you can savor the panoramic view of Peggy's Cove and the gorgeous coastline.</p>

<p>As we near Peggy's Cove, you'll experience the dramatic changing topography and enjoy numerous vistas of the Atlantic Ocean and its scenic inlet's and coves. </p>

<p>With a stop for Breakfast directly at the Peggy's Cove site, after we'll spend some time exploring the "most visited place in Canada" and two other nearby attractions, the "swimming hole" and "deGarth Memorial". </p>

<p>Our return route will take us along the shoreline of historic Saint Margaret's Bay, an area noted for its stories of religion, rum-running, bootlegging and connection to NASA, just to name a few! We'll stop for photo opportunities at Hackett's Cove and if you wish, visit the Swiss AirFlight 111 Memorial.</p>

<p>Returning to the hustle and bustle of down town Halifax on our way we can visit the Titanic Cemetery. Here, you will see the grave sites (and perhaps hear some stories) of the Titanic victims and learn of the Halifax connection to this 1912 maritime tragedy. </p>

<p>Continuing; our route will take us by the naval dockyard area, under both Harbour bridges and past the site of the 1917 Halifax Explosion and to conclude our first day, we'll drive to the "top of Halifax" for a spectacular photo opportunity at Halifax Citadel. The Citadel is the reason for the founding of Halifax in 1749.</p>

<p>Returning you back to your hotel for some leisure and self-exploration. There are over 35 formal dining options with in easy access and walking distance from your accommodations, over 60 sidewalk cafes that open in the summer months. The nightlife is made up of bars and small music venues as well as Casino Nova Scotia. </p>

<p>We're always ready for a recommendation given your choice of fare and budget, with that we'll bid you farewell until the next day.</p> 

<img src="../../images/novascotia/oldscotland/oldscotland2.jpg" class="img-rounded">

<h3>Day 2</h3>

<p>We believe this to be a rather special day and is a favorite of ours, Today will be for the Fundy Tides! </p>

<p>The Bay of Fundy is known for having some of the highest tides in the world.  The bay's extreme tidal range causes interesting phenomena in the various rivers that empty into it and along the coastline.  This can not only be seen but experienced in Nova Scotia. Are you ready to experience the highest tides in the world?</p>

<p>Each phase of the tidal cycle is 6 hours, 13 minutes</p>

<p>The average tidal range is 45.5 feet</p>

<p>Tide times move ahead one hour per day</p>

<p>Today, you will see and experience each tide phase (yes both high and low tide).  Leaving your hotel, we tour/drive through historic Halifax on our way to the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia, taking Nova Scotia's the Evangeline Trail to Hall's Harbour on the Bay of Fundy.</p>

<p>Hall's Harbour is named after Samuel Hall, an American privateer during the American Revolution who used the cove to raid settlements in the Annapolis Valley.  Now it's home to a Bay of Fundy fishing fleet and one of the largest lobster pounds in the world. Most importantly, its unique size makes it ideal place to most fully witness the startling wonder of the tides of Fundy.</p>

<p>After seeing either tidal phase, we trek over to ‘The Look-Off' on North Mountain Ridge, home to Glooscap, he of Mi'kmaq legend. On, a clear day, you can see the Bay of Fundy, Grand Pré, Wolfville, Acadia University, and much of the extensive rich farmland of the Annapolis Valley. </p>

<p>Next, we arrive at the Grand Pre-National Historic Site and learn the sad history of the Deportation of the Acadians in 1755. This site recalls the saddest and heroic moments of the deportation and illustrates for future generations the history of a courageous people whose culture and actions continue to enrich Canada to this day. Our visit will take approximately one hour.</p>

<p>As well, we will visit two other sites associated with this dark moment in Nova Scotia's history.</p>

<p>After Grand Pré, we visit the town of Wolfville, home to Acadia University and, at one time, an important prosperous agricultural community. As it is a college town, there are numerous eateries to choose from for lunch. On the edge of the town we'll find one of the French dykes that you can walk and begin to understand how the Acadians, and later Yorkshire emigrants created such rich and valuable farmland. Additional dining options are also available.</p>

<p><b>Annapolis Valley</b></p>

<p>The Annapolis Valley is noted world-wide for its fruit trees, particularly apple trees although there is also pear, plum, grape, cherry, and assorted berries and vegetables farmed here as well. It is true the Acadians had apple orchards but it was horticulturalist Charles Ramage Prescott who developed the apple industry in Nova Scotia from 1811 to 1859. Mr. Prescott was responsible for introducing numerous varieties including the Ribston, Northern Spy, Baldwin, and Gravenstein.</p>

<p>We'll drive/tour visit his former estate at Starr's Point which is one of the finest examples of Georgian architecture in Nova Scotia, as our destination, is again, Hall's Harbour and the other tidal phase.</p>

<p>Depending on your interests, we may also visit on this Tour:</p>
<ul>
<li>a farm markets</li>

<li>an award-winning winery</li>

<li>a cheese farms</li>

<li>a mini-brew pub</li>

<li>the birthplace of hockey</li>

<li>a farm where racing pumpkin yachts are grown </li>
</ul>
<img src="../../images/novascotia/oldscotland/oldscotland3.jpg" class="img-rounded">

<h3>Day 3</h3>

<p>Departing from your Halifax hotel, our first stop will be in Truro at the Millbrook Cultural and Heritage Centre. Here, we will learn about the Mi'kmaq and explore their history in Nova Scotia. This will allow us to understand the culture of Nova Scotia prior to settlers arriving.</p>

<p>Heading northwards, we'll meander along Northumberland Strait shoreline to the hamlet of Knoydart. Settled around 1787 by Martin, Malcom and Dougald McDonald, Knoydart was named after their native home in Scotland. Early settlers of this area also include Hugh McDonald, Donald MacPherson, and Angus MacDonald, veterans of the Battle of Culloden - the final confrontation of the 1745 Jacobite Rising. This was one of the last pitched battles to be fought on British soil and lasted less than hour! Highland warriors who managed to flee the battlefield were hunted down and killed, few lucky ones escaped.</p>

<p>A cairn is erected upon the shoreline in Knoydart to commemorate the Battle of Culloden. It honors those settlers and soldiers who survived the uprising and the crossing to forge new lives in the ‘new world', Nova Scotia. We'll spend some time in this area to stroll around the site, enjoy panoramic views and honor these brave warriors and settlers.</p>

<p>Continuing eastwards, we'll pass through the village of McArra's Brook. Settled in 1791, it was first called Moidart after its namesake place in Scotland until a British soldier, James McCara, changed the name to McCara's Brook. As we pass through, take some time to wonder what it was like for the settlers who arrived here… and look out to the Strait to see if you can catch a glimpse of the famous "Ghost Ship of the Northumberland Strait"!</p>

<p>We'll spend some time in Arisaig where we'll visit Arisaig Hill and the Provincial Park to view spectacular vistas of the harbour and learn a little about this fascinating community. A short drive will take us to the Lighthouse and Lobster Interpretive Centre. Here we'll lunch and enjoy some refreshments on the docks while basking in the beauty of the Northumberland Strait.</p>

<img src="../../images/novascotia/oldscotland/oldscotland4.jpg" class="img-rounded">

<p>We'll continue on and travel across the Canso Causeway - a 1,385 m rock-filled roadway crossing the Strait of Canso, with two vehicle lanes of traffic and a single railway track. It is the deepest causeway in the world, with a depth of 213 feet. The word "Canso" is believed to be derived from the Mi'kmaq word kamsok, which means "opposite the lofty cliffs".</p>

<p>We'll stop at the Cove Motel Restaurant for a great lunch and super views of the Causeway.</p>

<p>Ceilidh Trail: We'll follow the Ceilidh (pronounced kay-lee, a Gaelic word meaning party or gathering) Trail along the shoreline of the Gulf of St Lawrence. The roadway clings to a rugged shoreline (Saint George's Bay of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, "Canada's in-land sea") and skirts along the thickly-wooded, mountainous and rough terrain of central Cape Breton Island (Creignish, Big Ridge Mountains and Mabou Highlands). The scenery here is spectacular. We'll be passing places such as Port Hood, Mabou, Glenville, Dunvegan, St. Rose, Chimney Corner and Margaree Harbour, with breathtaking scenery and stunning seascapes found around every turn in the road.</p>

<img src="../../images/novascotia/oldscotland/oldscotland5.jpg" class="img-rounded">

<p>Just north of Mabou is the Town of Glenville where you'll find a true gem of Cape Breton, the Glen Breton Distillery. Renowned for its rare Canadian Single Malt Whisky, the only single malt whisky made in Canada, produced by using traditional copper pot stills method and only three ingredients: barley, yeast and water. (It cannot be called 'Scotch' unless it is produced in Scotland, hence the name, Canadian Single Malt Whisky). Glen Breton offers a guided tour of their operation which is always sure to please, we will be spending the night in Baddeck on the shores of the storied Bras d' Or Lakes.</p>

<h3>Day 4</h3>

<p>Today, we'll spend most of the day traveling the world-famous Cabot Trail. The Cabot Trail is one of the best road trips in the world and winds through stunning landscapes, along the Margaree River and through the spectacular rugged highlands of the Cape Breton Highlands National Park. The trail was named after Italian explorer John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto) who reached our shores in 1497, sailing on a mission for King Henry VII of England. The name also celebrates the meeting of Cabot and the Mi'kmaq people, the original inhabitants of Cape Breton Island.</p>

<p>The Cabot Trail, completed in 1932, joined previously isolated fishing villages along approximately, a 300 km loop. Today, the Cabot Trail connects eight major communities with intriguing histories, including Acadian, Irish and Scottish settlements.</p>

<p>Following our road trip, we'll visit the Alexander Graham Bell Museum. This national historic site communicates the story of Alexander Graham Bell's wide-ranging interests and inventive work, much of it undertaken in Baddeck. The site boasts about 10 hectares overlooking Baddeck Bay, on Bras d'Or Lake, and Beinn Bhreagh, Bell's summer home, where Bell pursued much of his scientific work. The museum commemorates and interprets the work of Alexander Graham Bell and his associates and also functions as a centre for the study of Bell's scientific and humanitarian work, as illustrated by the artifacts and documents preserved there. We'll spend the evening in Baddeck.</p>

<img src="../../images/novascotia/oldscotland/oldscotland6.jpg" class="img-rounded">

<h3>Day 5 </h3>

<p>Following a leisurely breakfast, we'll depart for Louisburg to explore a National Historic site.</p>

<p>Fortress Louisbourg is an intimate part of the fabric of Nova Scotian history, involving French, English, American, and Mi'kmaq peoples. It has been called the 'Gibraltar of North America' and was so expensive to build, that Louis the Fourteenth, of France "expected to see its walls from Paris"! Originally, settled in 1713 by a French expedition relocating from Placentia, Newfoundland, by 1740, Louisbourgs population grew to reach 2500 civilians and 700 garrison personnel. The population was comprised of Bretons, Normans, Basques and other French, along with Germans, Swiss, Irish and Africans, and local Mi'kmaq – quite a medley of cultures!</p>

<p>In 1928, Fortress Louisbourg was proclaimed a National Historic Site and in 1961, the Government of Canada began to reconstruct one-fifth of Louisbourg, using the original blueprints to recreate identical building units. Today, it's the largest fortress re-construction site in North America, with over 25 open buildings for you to explore.</p>

<p>During your visit, you will find dozens of costumed animators who portray the residents of 1744. Period costumes and exhibits line the streets and along the busy waterfront. See how the wealthy elite lived, contrasting to the very different life experienced by the poor. We will provide you with a private, one-hour, guided tour of this Fortress, then you will have ample time to explore the unique site on your own.</p>

<p>We'll be dining in Louisbourg, so bring your hunger to one of the 18th-century restaurants. The food is fresh and plentiful, the recipes are from the 18th-century and the atmosphere is New France in the New World! Hotel De la Marine is a busy waterfront tavern and where mariners, soldiers and fishermen would have supped, with only a spoon on the table. Grandchamps is another lively waterfront cabaret or perhaps you would prefer L'Epee Royale, which recreates the atmosphere and menu of a comfortable inn, an upscale eatery where the tavern crowd rarely ventured…and a place where you can show your proper breeding and eat with a full set of cutlery!</p>

<p>We'll return to Baddeck for the evening.</p>

<img src="../../images/novascotia/oldscotland/oldscotland7.jpg" class="img-rounded">

<h3>Day 6</h3>

<p>Leaving Baddeck, we'll meander our way through spectacular scenery to Bras d' Or Look-off which will allow for amazing views of the Bras d'Or lakes. We'll continue on to St. Peter's, where we'll cross St Peter's Canal - an 800m canal linking the Atlantic Ocean with the Bras d'Or Lakes. Work started on this canal in 1854 and was completed in 1869. The canal also boasts the only functioning lock system in Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>Once again, we'll cross the Canso Causeway back onto the mainland and enjoy a scenic drive to the town of Pictou. Located on the beautiful Northumberland Shore of Nova Scotia, Pictou is known as the "Birthplace of New Scotland" as it was here, the first wave of Scottish immigrants landed in 1773. Explore the world class Hector Heritage Quay and board the full-sized Ship Hector replica, search for your ancestral roots, shop for Grohmann Knives or hunt for the perfect souvenir, you may want to bask on the beach, learn more about Celtic music or tap your toes at the Red Shoe Pub! the choice is yours. We'll return to Halifax in time for your evening meal.</p>

<img src="../../images/novascotia/oldscotland/oldscotland8.jpg" class="img-rounded">

<h3>Day 7</h3>

</p>Sweet goodbye's, At the appropriate time we'll get you ready and off for your next part of the adventure, your flight to Scotland. This flight should run approximately eight and half to nine hours total until your greeted by our friends in the "Old Country". 

<h3>Day 8</h3></p>You'll arrive at Glasgow Airport - Port Glasgow and we'll tour you around the city before leaving for   Greenock main embarkation ports for emigrants to Canada where between 1820 and 1920 some thirty-five million persons came in and out of Scotland many of which leaving for New York and then bound for Canada. We'll board our first ferry in  Gourock , The name comes from a Gaelic word for "pimple", in reference to the hill above the town. As far back as 1494 it is recorded that James IV sailed from the shore at Gourock to quell the rebellious Highland clans. On a quirky note Gourock has one of the three remaining public outdoor swimming pools in Scotland. Gourock Outdoor Pool was built in 1909 and reconstructed in 1969, it was once tidal and had a sandy floor.

<p>Across to Dunoon , The early history of Dunoon often revolves around two feuding clans: the Lamonts and the Campbells Dunoon was a popular destination when travel by steamships was common around the Firth of Clyde; Glaswegians described this as going "Doon the watter". The Town in the Cold War Era became a garrison town and seen the arrival of some of the first ICBM's in Europe. Next, we'll explore the wild and rugged Argyll Forest Park, from the magical trails at Puck's Glen to the long sandy beach at Ardentinny. Leaving wilderness behind we're off to Inveraray and visit Inveraray Castle, home of the Duke of Argyll, chief of Clan Campbell. A whirlwind day of sights but it isn't over yet.</p>

<p>We'll travel to Loch Awe, at 28 miles in length it is the longest fresh water loch (or lake) in the UK, it holds the current record for the largest Brown Trout caught in the British Isles and has, Kilchurn Castle, arguably Scotland's most impressive & Iconic ancient building and ancestral home of clan Campbell, at its head. Winding the day down we'll travel to Dunollie Castle. For centuries the most important fortress of the Chiefs of Clan MacDougall, perches on the summit of a 90ft high outcrop of rock that guards the narrow passage into Oban Bay between the mainland and the north end of the island of Kerrera.. Our last castle of the day is Dunstaffanage Castle, we'll visit this mighty stronghold of the ‘Kings of the Isles' where Jacobite heroine Flora MacDonald was believed to have been held in prisoner. We'll bed down in Oban for the evening in this "seafood capital of Scotland", Where eateries cluster by the harbour.</p>

<p>Oban is also one of Scotland's oldest sources of Single Malt Scotch Whisky is just a short meander from the sea.</p>

<img src="../../images/novascotia/oldscotland/oldscotland9.jpg" class="img-rounded">

<h3>Day 9</h3>

 <p>Following breakfast, we'll travel further north to Glencoe. The road through Glencoe takes you through the heart of an ancient volcano and glaciers and fiery explosions carved out the glen's rugged mountain peaks. Perhaps we'll stumble upon some iconic film locations, Glencoe is one of the most beautiful and other-worldly places in Scotland. It's even featured in films such as James Bond's Skyfall and several Harry Potter movies however the village may be best known by its historical significance of being the site of infamous 1692 massacre of MacDonalds. Next, Fort William a main embarkation point for emigrants to Canada. - Leaving Fort William behind we're off to Glenfinnan the once home of John MacDonald of Glenaladale who led the vanguard of 800 emigrants to PEI, also site of the gathering of the clans at the start of the 1745 uprising.</p>

<p>Depending on your taste maybe we can catch lunch in the Glenfinnan Station Museum Dining Car with some beautiful views from the carriage window. After lunch or continuing on to Morar, Scotland's deepest loch & shortest river and the Silver Sands of Morar. Our next ferry trip is in Mallaig departing for Armadale , Travelling from Mallaig  gives you a spectacular first glimpse of what Skye has to offer. The Sleat Peninsula on which Armadale is located is fairly low lying, and your attention is gripped by the startlingly jagged peaks of the Cuillin mountains towering above it: despite their location 15 miles further away.</p>

<p>Armadale could be considered the Isle of Skye's back door and we'll explore further to the Clan Donald Visitor Centre & Museum of the Isles and on to Portree. Skye was a major embarkation point for emigrants including many MacDonalds and MacLeods who were the two main clans on the island. We'll spend the night in Portree, the name Portree or Port Righ, King's Port in Gaelic, (as on the road signs) is popularly thought to derive from a visit by King James V (of Scotland) in 1540 but the area around the harbour was called Portree or Portray long before the arrival of the king. Its name really comes from the Gaelic for Port on the Slope.  Portree, situated on the east side of Skye overlooking a sheltered bay, is the capital of the island.</p>

<img src="../../images/novascotia/oldscotland/oldscotland9.jpg" class="img-rounded">

<h3>Day 10</h3>

<p>After breakfast we're back on the road for a short drive to  Uig.,Set in a sheltered horseshoe-shaped bay on Skye, Uig is a ferry port to the Western Isles where we will take our third ferry to  Tarbert is the hub of the Isle of Harris, a dramatic island of mountains and beaches,Tarbert was once the main settlement of the Isle and a Harris Tweed mill had been set up here by 1900.We'll continue on through the rolling hills of Airidh a` Bhruaich</p>

<p>  To Stornoway, Isle of Lewis. Perhaps we can stroll along the quay at Stornoway Harbour and hear the shouts of the fishermen as the traditional fleet land the catch of the day before shipping it out to the island's amazing eateries, smell the unmistakeable odour of peat on the air as the smokehouses turn the seafood specimens into island specialities and feel the winds off The Minch that carry so many here from the mainland. Stornoway was the site were hundreds sailed from Stornoway in 1923 aboard a Canadian cruise liner. The departure from Stornoway of the Canadian Pacific liners Metagama, Canada and Marloch in 1923 and 1924 is still remembered by those who were children at the time for the emotional scenes at the harbour as they sailed away, tearing asunder many families.</p>

<p>Most of those destined to a new life continued to make contact by letter, some did not, but many did eventually return for joyous family reunions and some returned to Lewis for good. In earlier days it was almost certainly going to be a one-way journey for those leaving for the Americas, holidays were certainly not an option unless one was to strike gold or have worked for years to establish a wealthy business. We'll be bedding down here for the night.</p>

 <img src="../../images/novascotia/oldscotland/oldscotland10.jpg" class="img-rounded">

<h3>Day 11</h3>

<p>Leaving the Isle of Lewis behind we'll take our fourth ferry back to the main land and to Ullapool. In 1773 the old Dutch vessel, Hector was, taking onboard a group of people from the Highlands. These people were joining a few others who had already joined the ship in the Clyde area. All the people had one thing in common. They wanted to find a new land where they had freedom to speak their Gaelic language, play their music and wear their cherished tartan. It was only 28 years after the Battle of Culloden and life in Scotland was hard and repressive.</p> 
<p>189 passengers comprising 25 single men, 33 families, a piper and their agent had joined the ship and were willing to start a new free life in a new land.</p>

<p>Next were off to Durness in Sutherland county. The highlands county of Sutherland is among western Europe's least-populated areas, with epic vistas of fells, wild coast, and some surprising cultural treats. Leaving this paradise our next stop is Scrabster, The most northerly large port in mainland Britain and can be found a mile and a half north west of the centre of Thurso at the east end of Thurso Bay.</p>

<p>It nestles in the shelter of the low grass-covered cliffs of Holborn Head which sweep round to the north and as a result Scrabster actually looks east across Thurso Bay towards Dunnet Head rather than, as you might expect, north towards Orkney, for which it serves as the main ferry terminus. It's here we will take our fifth ferry of our adventure to Orkney and bed down for the night.</p>

<img src="../../images/novascotia/oldscotland/oldscotland11.jpg" class="img-rounded">

<h3>Day 12</h3>

<p>Once your refreshed and following breakfast we'll spend the day touring Orkney, Orkney is a group of 67 islands lying off the north coast of Caithness. Only about a third of the islands are inhabited. After centuries of Norwegian rule, Orkney was annexed as part of Scotland by James III in 1468 after its rents had been pledged as security against a dowry that was not paid. The Norwegians have never formally recognised Orkney as part of Scotland.</p>

<p>A short drive away we'll visit Skara Brae. The Neolithic settlement of Skara Brae is one of the best-preserved groups of prehistoric houses in Western Europe.</p>

<p>Uncovered by a storm in 1850, Skara Brae gives a remarkable picture of life 5,000 years ago, before Stonehenge was built.</p>

<p>Explore this prehistoric village and see ancient homes fitted with stone beds, dressers and seats. The domestic details are deeply touching: you get an incredible sense of seeing into the day-to-day lives of the nameless people who lived here.</p>

<p>Next and tide dependant is The Brough of Birsay,a tidal island off the north east tip of West Mainland. What makes it special is that for over five hundred years it was an important settlement for two different cultures, the Picts and the Norse, before being abandoned for more easily accessible sites. As it was never redeveloped, large parts of those settlements are visible on the ground. The Brough is tidal, and access is only possible for a couple of hours either side of low tide.

<p>Next is St Magnus Cathedral, often known as the "Light in the North", is Britain's most northerly cathedral and it dominates the heart of the town of Kirkwall.</p>

<p>Next, we'll visit Stromness the home of "The Haven Bay" the recruiting headquarters of the Hudson's Bay Company were the historic office still stands. We'll depart so you may Stand in awe of one of Europe's finest chambered tombs, built some 5,000 years ago. Incredibly, the entrance passage to Maeshowe is aligned with the setting of the midwinter sun, so that the light illuminates the tomb's interior. Our last destination will be the Broch of Gurness. Brochs are unique to Scotland. There are over 500 of them, the vast majority spread throughout the northern and western Highlands and the islands. Many of these tall circular towers stood alone, but in Orkney they were generally surrounded by sizeable villages. </p>

<p>The broch village at Gurness is one of the most impressive. It has also been archaeologically excavated, thus providing a more vivid impression of life in the Scottish Iron Age than other comparable sites. We'll be returning to Stromness for the evening.</p>

<img src="../../images/novascotia/oldscotland/oldscotland12.jpg" class="img-rounded">

<h3>Day 13</h3>

<p>Following breakfast, we'll be returning to Scrabster and making our way to Thurso. Mainland Scotland's most northerly town, and home to the country's most northerly railway station. Located on the north coast of Caithness, its seaward views are dominated by the distant cliffs of Dunnet Head to the north east, and those of the island of Hoy, one of the Orkney Islands, to the north.Thurso is also a major surfing area and a premier heavy cold surf destination which hosts surfing championships, including two World Championships for Kayak surfing.</p>

<p>Making our way to Kildonan the site of one of the most famous clearances and one set of emigrants who ended up in Winnipeg after an epic adventure, also home to the 'Emigrants' statue above the town.</p>

<p>Next, How about another Castle? Dunrobin Castle is the most northerly of Scotland's great houses and the largest in the Northern Highlands with 189 rooms. Dunrobin Castle is also one of Britain's oldest continuously inhabited houses dating back to the early 1300s, home to the Earls and later, the Dukes of Sutherland.</p>

<h3>Day 14</h3>

<p>Inverness, capital of the highlands, became Scotland's fifth city in celebration of the start of the Third Millennium. It lies at the north end of the Great Glen, where the River Ness flows into the Moray Firth, and has been a natural focus for lines of communication to and through the highlands for most of the last two thousand years. We'll tour throughout the city before heading for the Culloden Battlefield from The Final Jacobite Rising. We'll visit the interpretation center and explore the artefacts, including Bonnie Prince Charlie's letters, weapons, clothing, miniatures and coins. Back on the road and close to inverness we'll visit the Clava Cairns, a well-preserved Bronze Age cemetery complex of passage graves; ring cairns, kerb cairns and standing stones in a beautiful setting.</p>
