							<p>With over 800 acres of vineyards and 400 years of grape growing, Nova Scotia is home to a 
							thriving wine industry.  With increasing national and international attention, as well as 
							hundreds of award winning wines, Nova Scotian wine is something we are proud of and want to 
							share with you.</p>

							<p>We have designed this three-day tour to encompass a wide selection of our wineries, which, 
							when paired with superb local food and spectacular scenery, will leave you yearning to return.
							As with all Blue Diamond Tours, below is a sample of what we can offer - you have the choice 
							to change it and truly make your tour, your way.   We want this to be your unique, "Uncorked 
							Adventure!"</p>

							<h2>Day 1 - Annapolis Valley</h2>
							
							<p><img src="../../images/novascotia/sainte-famille.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Photo: Aerial  view of a vineyard."></p>
							
							<p>Travelling over scenic, country roads, our first port of call will be in the small, coastal 
							community of Avondale at Avondale Sky Winery.  This picturesque winery is built on an old 
							vineyard and the building in which it is housed, a re-purposed church, well known for its 
							journey on the Bay of Fundy - a story in itself!  Tour the winery and sample their selection in 
							what the <em>Globe and Mail</em> has called, "...one of the most tranquil and lovely wine tasting rooms 
							in the world."  </p>

							<p>Following the coastline, our next stop will be in the Annapolis valley at Domaine De Grand Pr&eacute;. 
							This gorgeous winery not only produces award winning wines but also boasts an award winning 
							restaurant!  With the Bay of Fundy as a back drop, explore this beautiful vineyard, tour their 
							wine museum then sit, sip and savour the flavours of their superb wine and cuisine.
							Meandering through the university town of Wolfville, we'll drive over ancient Acadian dykes to 
							the village of Port Williams.  Planters Ridge, aptly named to reflect the rich history of the area, 
							is housed in a renovated 150yr old barn which boasts a state-of-the art winery and spectacular 
							views across the Annapolis Valley. Enjoy this artisanal winery and "taste the tradition and 
							passion" in every sip.</p>

							<p>A short drive through this scenic area of Nova Scotia will take us to Blomidon Estate Winery on 
							the shores of the Minas Basin.  This boutique winery produces 100% Nova Scotian wine with 
							grapes grown on the estate. Enjoy a stroll through the vineyards and cellar prior to sampling a 
							selection of their valley wine.</p>

							<p>Leaving the low lying valley, we'll travel to Blomidon Look-off where stunning panoramic views 
							of the Annapolis Valley and its wineries will captivate you. We'll end our day visiting Halls 
							Harbour, an authentic fishing village on the Bay of Fundy, where a dinner of "Lobster in the 
							Rough" paired with local wine, while watching the sunset over the World's highest tides, may 
							be the perfect ending to a perfect day.</p>

							<p>Following dinner, we'll return to your hotel in Halifax.</p>

							<h2>Day 2 - Coastal Vines</h2>
							
							<p><img src="../../images/novascotia/bike.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="A pair of cyclers stand on a cliff looking at the ocean with binocular on a sunny day."></p>

							<p>Leaving the bustling, noisy city behind us we'll drive up-country to the coastal community of 
							Malagash, home to Nova Scotia's largest and oldest winery, Jost Vineyards.   With wines for 
							every occasion and winning "hundreds of national and international awards" you are sure to 
							enjoy the Jost Experience!  Following a tour of the vineyard and perhaps a sampling in their 
							tasting room, why not grab a picnic basket, bottle of wine and enjoy a picnic lunch among the 
							vines?  If you're feeling invigorated from the fresh sea air, hop on a bike, explore the trails along 
							the coastline in search of that perfect, secluded picnic spot! </p>

							<p>After a relaxing afternoon exploring this picturesque shoreline, we'll visit one of Nova Scotia's 
							premier resorts, Fox Harb'r where you can indulge yourself in a fine dining experience. Dinner 
							will be prepared by a team of culinary experts and showcase the unique flavours of Nova Scotia, 
							which when paired with their superb wine collection, is sure to be a memorable dinner and 
							night to remember.</p>

							<p>Following dinner, we'll return to your hotel in Halifax.</p>

							<h2>Day 3 - Gaspereau Valley</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/fundy/winery.jpg" alt="Sign that says 'Avondale Sky Winery', in the background is the old church that is now the winery." class="img-thumbnail"></p>
							<p>Our morning will begin with a tour of Sainte-Famille Wines, a small, family-owned winery 
							located on an old, Acadian settlement overlooking the picturesque Avon River Valley. We'll 
							stroll through the scenic vineyard, tour the winery and sample a selection of their wines prior to 
							our final wine tasting adventure in the Gaspereau Valley.</p>

							<p>The Gaspereau Valley is home to three award winning vineyards, the first of which we'll visit is 
							Luckett Vineyards.  Established in 2010, this is one of the newer vineyards in the area and is 
							situated on the slopes of Gaspereau Valley. Stroll through the vineyard and enjoy spectacular 
							view of Blomidon...so stunning you'll want to call home, which is why there is a red British 
							telephone box in the middle of the vineyard!  Sample a selection of wine, perhaps pairing it 
							with an assortment of local produce, specifically chosen to compliment the red, white and fruit 
							wines.</p>

							<p>A short drive through the valley will take us to Gaspereau Vineyards, a small, boutique winery 
							showcasing some of the best wines Nova Scotia has to offer. Once a dairy farm and apple 
							orchard, this 50 acre property has been transformed into a vineyard and passionately producing 
							top quality wines ever since.  Stroll through the vines, perhaps hop on a bike to explore the area 
							further or simply relax and savour the flavours.</p>

							<p>The final vineyard we'll visit is Benjamin Bridge, Canada's most acclaimed "Sparkling Wine 
							House".  Beppi Crosariol, renowned wine critic for the Globe and Mail said of their sparkling 
							wines: "one of the best Canadian wines I've tasted" and "rivals Champagne".  In addition to 
							sparkling wines, Benjamin Bridge also offers premium wines, including the famous Nova 7, a 
							Nova Scotian favourite.  We are sure you will enjoy an exclusive tour of the vineyard, learn of its 
							history and savour the delight of a private pouring in the tasting room.<p>  

							<p>To end our tour, we'll travel to Wolfville and dine in the historic Blomidon Inn.  The Inn offers 
							wonderful Nova Scotian fare, fresh from land and sea, which can be complimented with wine 
							chosen from, according to <em>Wine Spectator</em> magazine, one of the "World's Best Restaurant 
							Wine Lists."</p>

							<p>Following dinner, we'll return to your hotel in Halifax.</p>
