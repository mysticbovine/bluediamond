							<p>Departing your local accommodator or cruise dock we'll briefly and scenically tour historic Halifax before heading to Dartmouth via the Angus L. MacDonald Bridge, which opened in 1955 and is the older of the two harbour bridges.  We’ll have a quick drive through the city of Dartmouth, founded in 1750, before we head out along the rugged coastline.</p>
							<p>Along the way and your interests and time considered perhaps a stop into The Shearwater Aviation Museum's mandate is to collect, preserve, display and promote the history of Maritime Military Aviation at the air station now known as 12 Wing Shearwater, from 1918 to the present time. </p>
							<p>Passing by the entry point for most European cars to North America we’ll stop at a functioning and wonderfully quaint and restored 200-year-old fishing village. Rich in history, it offers visitors a peek into the past with a variety of modern-day activities and events.We always suggest a Stroll the picturesque boardwalk and visit the many shops and eateries where you will find delicious food, Maritime crafts, local paintings, unique folk art, and souvenirs to bring home. An excellent spot for photographs and perhaps a chance to chat with local fishermen. Before we depart we suggest a stop in for a tour of the beautiful Heritage Centre and learn a little of the rich and globally connected history of this site such as tales of the iron Confederate naval cruiser Tallahassee which sailed into the Eastern Passage narrows on August 18, 1864 to take on bunker coal and water.</p>
							<p>We’ll continue to follow “Marine Drive” a road less traveled passing spectacular ocean views, cobble stone and white-sand beaches and a quick scenic view of the harbor front with some tales of “Devil’s Island”  and departing where scenic vistas continue as we drive through the rolling along the rugged Atlantic coastline.</p>
							<p>Our next stop Lawrence Town Beach national park.This popular sand-and-cobble beach is noted for its world renown winter surfing and on any fair weathered day you can watch the various surfers ride the strong tides and currents that make this area a fan favourite.</p>
							<p>Perhaps before leaving take in some lunch at the Heron’s Nest Tea Room a local favorite.</p>
							<p>Depending on your interests and time considered perhaps a visit to Hope for Wildlife. A different from a zoo because it is a rehabilitation facility that cares for injured and orphaned wildlife. You can meet the education animals in the Wildlife Gardens and the Learning Centre. The centre opened in 1997, and has cared for and released over 40,000 wild animals over the past 20 years. </p>
							<p>Continuing on to Three Fathom Harbour, just east of Lawrence town Beach, Fisherman's Reserve is a quaint and active fishing village that is protected by a huge rock breakwater.  The breakwater provides shelter from the harsh Atlantic seas.  Vessels still use and need its protection.  The main fishing community is linked to the mainland via a causeway, where Acadian fishermen from Chezzetcook, Grand Desert and Seaforth have fished from for many years.   The fishermen would tend to their boats in the summer, occupying the many fishing huts that line the shore.</p>
							<p>Before making our way back to Halifax via a different route through the bustle of Dartmouth we can stop for a quick rest and perhaps a snack at the Rose & Rooster Bakery. They serve NS roasted coffees and espresso that pair great with their fresh sweet treats that you can enjoy on the front or back patio on a sunny day.</p>
