							<p>Leaving the hectic city behind us, we'll head inland to an historic 186 acre farm specializing in hops and lavender. <strong>Meander River Farm and Brewery</strong> is a family run brewery where we can stroll through the 'hopyard', tour the brewery and learn about the craft beer process.  Taste the award winning Surf and Turf Scotch Ale or sip on Meander River Homegrown, an ale produced entirely with hops grown on the farm. This brewery tour is sure to be a palate pleaser!</p>

							<p>Continuing across country, we'll head to the small, coastal community of Avondale to visit the award winning <strong>Avondale Sky Winery</strong>.  This picturesque winery is built on one of the oldest vineyards in Nova Scotia and the building in which it is housed, a re-purposed church, well known for its journey on the Bay of Fundy - a story in itself!  Tour the winery and sample their selection in, what the 'Globe and Mail' has called, "...one of the most tranquil and lovely wine tasting rooms in the world."</p> 

							<p>Keeping with the coastal theme, our next port of call with be at <strong>Sea Level Brewing</strong> where we can taste their selection of ales while enjoying lunch in the adjoining gastropub and bistro.  This brewing company offers an assortment of beers ranging from a speciality, fruit Blooberry Pail Ale to the more traditional Planter's Pale Ale. Enjoy the unique flavours while relaxing on the waterside deck, basking in the glory of the beautiful Annapolis Valley.</p>

							<p>Our return trip to Halifax will take us through the Gaspereau Valley with, if time allows, a brief stop at <strong>Gaspereau Vineyards</strong>.  This small, boutique winery showcases some of the best wines Nova Scotia has to offer and is well known for its superb Reislings. The idyllic location and delicious offerings will leave you with a thirst to return!</p>

							<p>Following our final wine tasting, we'll return to your ship or hotel in Halifax.</p>
