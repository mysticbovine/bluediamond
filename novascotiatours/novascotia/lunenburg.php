						  <h2>Halifax</h2>
							<p>Let us take you on an enchanting journey to the scenic South Shore of Nova Scotia - aptly named by 
							National Geographic as one of the Top 10 Coastal Destinations in the world.  We'll explore the rustic 
							charm of Nova Scotia's seacoast while enjoying the modern delights it has to offer. 

							<p>Departing from your hotel, we offer a guided driving tour of the historic city of Halifax, taking into 
							view: Historic properties; Halifax Harbour; the site of the 1917 Halifax Explosion; Halifax Citadel; the 
							Titanic Cemetery and the Public Gardens.  

							<p>Leaving the city behind us, we'll follow a scenic route known as the "Lighthouse Route" which meanders 
							along the South Shore of Nova Scotia.  As the name suggests, look for charming lighthouses along the rugged 
							shoreline and peninsulas.  </p>

							<h2>Chester</h2>
							<p>Our first port of call is Chester - a beautiful, unique community which was a one-time fishing village
							but is now a wealthy resort community and home to the largest keelboat regatta in Canada.  Chester boasts
							a beautiful harbour, quaint streets, superb architecture and some stunning scenery.  It truly represents
							ocean living at its finest.</p>

							<p>As we leave Chester, look inland to see if you can spot teams of oxen out for their daily exercise.  
							This area is well known for its award winning oxen teams and it's not an uncommon sight to see them 
							along the side of the road.</p>

							<h2>Mahone Bay</h2>
							<p>Mahone Bay is a picture-perfect postcard town noted for its three churches -an iconic Nova Scotian 
							image. Mahone Bay is also home to a lovely harbour, specialty shops and superb cafes and restaurants.
							Some say it's the finest romantic weekend getaway spot in Nova Scotia!  Take time to stroll through 
							the streets and enjoy some of Mahone Bay's charm, delicacies and offerings.</p>

							<h2>Lunenburg</h2>
							<p>Our last major stop is in the Town of Lunenburg - one of only two UNESCO World Heritage towns in North
							America. It was founded in 1753 and to this day, maintains its unique identity through amazing architecture
							(such as the Lunenburg Academy), brightly painted buildings and breathtaking scenery.</p>  

							<p>Lunenburg is home port for the world famous fishing schooner Bluenose II - a replica of the Bluenose
							(A celebrated racing and fishing vessel and a Canadian icon).  The Bluenose II can often be seen in the
							bustling harbour along with many other fishing boats - Lunenburg is known as the "Fishing Capital of the
							World" and is home to the Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic.</p>

							<p>We'll take a brief tour of the town including a stop at the historic, 250+ year old Gothic Revival style
							St. John's Anglican Church.  This lovely church was almost completely destroyed by fire on Halloween in 2001,
							but has since been completely and lovingly restored to its former grandeur.  While here, we will be able to
							view the church's copy of the Vinegar Bible, so called because it contains a typographical error, substituting
							vinegar for vineyard in the Gospel of Luke.  Printed in 1717 by John Baskett, this particular Bible - one of 
							three with the typo - is older than Halifax.</p> 

							<p>Following our tour, you will have time to explore this unique world heritage site on your own (approximately 
							one hour +/-) before we begin our return trip to your hotel.</p>
