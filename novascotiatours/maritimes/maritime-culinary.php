							  <h2>Day One: Haliax to Prince Edward Island</h2>
							  <p>From your hotel, we'll travel northwards to the Cobequid Hills where we'll explore all things maple 
							  at a unique maple syrup farm.  Learn about the "magic and mystery" of maple syrup making, take a short 
							  stroll along one of the numerous trails among the maple trees and to top off this maple experience, enjoy 
							  a tasty 'maple' brunch in a rustic log cabin!  Taste of Nova Scotia voted this farm as 2015's 'Restaurant 
							  of the Year - Essence of Nova Scotia' so it will surely be a taste bud pleaser!</p>
							  <p>Following brunch, we'll head to the town of Pictou, the "Birth place of New Scotland".  If time allows, 
							  we can explore the Ship Hector (which brought the first wave of Scottish immigrants to Nova Scotia in 1773) 
							  and also tour the world-famous, Gromahnn Knives factory - a chef's best friend!</p>
							  <p>Pictou is only a short drive to Caribou where we'll board the ferry for a 75 minute crossing to Prince 
							  Edward Island.  Outdoor seating (and weather permitting), will allow for spectacular views and refresh your 
							  appetite for the evening ahead. </p>
							  <p>Upon docking in PEI, we'll drive along the "Points East Coastal Drive" to Bay Fortune, where you'll spend 
							  the night in Eastern PEI's first five-star Inn.  Here, a "feast" awaits you!</p>
							  <p>Owned by one of Canada's top chefs, this evening will surely be a memorable one.  From an "all-you-can-eat", 
							  slurpable, Oyster Bar to a uniquely served meal - this experience will not disappoint. Learn where the food is 
							  locally sourced (perhaps even meet some of the farmers who provide the food), watch the chefs as they cook your 
							  entire meal on a wood burning fire, hear how your food was prepared and perhaps even help the chefs create dinner!  
							  This is genuine Maritime hospitality at its finest!  </p>
							  <img src="../../images/maritimes/oysters.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="PEI Oysters">
							  
							  <h2>Day Two: Brackley Beach and the day is yours</h2>
							  <p>Following breakfast (with friends you met the night before), we'll head towards Brackley Beach to check-in to 
							  our hotel for the night.  The day is yours to spend as you wish - whether touring Cavendish and the Anne of Green
							  Gables area or heading to Charlottetown, the birth place of confederation - the choice is yours.  Dinner will be 
							  at a local restaurant in Brackley Beach which not only offers a superb menu but also beautiful gardens, an art 
							  gallery and pottery studio.</p>
							  <img src="../../images/maritimes/brackleybeach.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Brackley Beach">
							  
							  <h2>Day Three: Cow's Ice Cream to looking for Fossils.</h2>
							  <p>In the morning, we'll meander our way towards Confederation Bridge (the world's 'longest bridge over ice-covered 
							  water' and one of Canada's top engineering achievements) and perhaps explore quaint communities, taste 'Cows' Ice Cream
							  or shop for gifts along the way.</p>
							  <p>On return to Nova Scotia, our first stop will be at Joggins, a UNESCO world heritage site on the Bay of Fundy.  This
							  wonderful interpretive centre will guide you through an existence long gone and allow you to explore the cliffs and beach
							  for rocks and fossils dating back 300 million years ago!  It truly is an awe inspiring experience.  We will lunch at the
							  local caf&eacute; which specializes in locally-sourced fresh produce.</p>
							  <p>Continuing our trip along this part of the Fundy shoreline, we'll head to our next port of call, Advocate Harbour.  
							  Here, we'll check-in to your accommodation and then the time is yours to relax and enjoy the peace, serenity and spectacular
							  scenery surrounding you or if you feel you have to work-off some calories, perhaps a short kayaking trip or hike awaits you?</p>
							  <p>Dinner will be at an award winning restaurant specializing in gourmet, locally-sourced food.  Eat, drink and unwind while 
							  watching the sun set over the world's highest tides. Aah, life is good!</p>
							  <img src="../../images/maritimes/advocate.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Cliffs of Cape Chignecto, Cape Chignecto Provincial Park, Advocate Harbour, Nova Scotia">
							  
							  <h2>Day Four: Stay, eat, cook, learn, appreciate and relax.</h2>
							  <p>The following morning, we'll continue our drive along the Fundy coastline to the town of Parrsboro.  We'll spend
							  some time exploring this little town before heading further along the coast line to a cheese lover's dream - an 
							  award winning artisan cheese farm.  Oh the taste that awaits you - your mouth will love you forever!</p>
							  <p>We'll make a quick stop at one of Nova Scotia's most popular farmers markets before touring along the opposite 
							  Fundy coastline.  We'll pass through historic shipbuilding communities, see the "home" of the World's highest tides 
							  and enjoy sensational views of the Bay of Fundy, all on our way to the tiny village of Summerville.  Here, as they 
							  say, "Stay, eat, cook, learn, appreciate and relax."  Well, that's just what we'll have to do! The menu is constantly 
							  changing, the atmosphere is amazing and it's a celebration of local food and hospitality (This can be a "hands-on" 
							  cooking experience. If you would like to participate in one of their culinary classes - just let us know!).</p>
							  <p>No trip to Nova Scotia, would be complete without a visit to a winery, so we end this culinary adventure in the 
							  tiny, picturesque village of Avonport, at a boutique winery.  This award winning winery is built on one of the oldest 
							  vineyards in Nova Scotia and the building in which it is housed, is a re-purposed church, well known for its journey on the Bay of Fundy from Walton to Avonport - a story in itself!  This Nova Scotian wine tour and sampling, accompanied by a meal made from a delicious array of locally sourced ingredients, is the perfect way to end our culinary adventure</p>
							  <p>Travelling across scenic country roads, you'll be back in Halifax for your evening meal.</p>
